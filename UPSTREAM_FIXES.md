# Upstream Fixes & Enhancements — airfield-range

Running log of issues, gaps, and suggested improvements discovered while deploying `airfield-range`. Candidates for PRs or discussion with the `range-development-ansible` maintainers, or for re-copies from PowerPlant when an existing PowerPlant fix needs to be brought across.

Per the [role-sourcing memory](../../.claude/projects/-Users-eric-starace-vCity/memory/project_airfield_role_sourcing.md): when an upstream fix is needed in airfield-range too, re-copy it explicitly **and log it here the same turn** (per the [UPSTREAM_FIXES feedback memory](../../.claude/projects/-Users-eric-starace-vCity/memory/feedback_upstream_fixes_log.md)).

Severity key:
- **bug** — role malfunctions or produces incorrect results
- **gap** — missing functionality that ranges have to work around
- **enhancement** — works but could be more robust or ergonomic
- **platform** — SimSpace platform-side issue, not Ansible

Format: `## 2026-09-22 · bug · reboot ceilings of 600s fail members on a cold build

**Symptom.** Two members fail outright in attempt 1, then surface hours later at the Fleet coverage gate:

```
[FAILED] strip_apipa : Reboot if autoconfig setting changed
      hosts: fops-ops08, fops-ops05
      msg  : Timed out waiting for last boot time check (timeout=600.0)
```

**Root cause.** `win_reboot` defaults to `reboot_timeout: 600`, and several tasks either set it explicitly or inherited it. Ten minutes is not a cold Windows boot on freshly provisioned hardware. The reboot itself works; the task stops waiting.

**Previously half-fixed, and the half that was missed is the point.** The shared `Reboot Windows` handler went 600 → 1800 on 2026-09-19 after both DCs failed the same way. That change came with an audit of every `win_reboot` in the repo — which saw `strip_apipa` at 600 and concluded only domain controllers boot slowly enough to matter. Members are not fine. Three days later two of them failed on exactly that value.

**Fix.** Every `win_reboot` in both repos is now 1800, explicitly, including the two that were relying on the default:

| | |
|---|---|
| airfield | `strip_apipa`, `domain_member_retry/join_pass`, `common/hostname` (was implicit) |
| ss-pp-stacked | `strip_apipa`, `splunk-forwarder/windows` (was implicit) |

Already at 1800: `handlers`, `dcpromo`.

**Why a generous ceiling is nearly free.** `win_reboot` returns as soon as the host answers, so a machine back in 90 seconds costs 90 seconds regardless of the setting. The ceiling is spent only on hosts that are genuinely slow — which are precisely the hosts a short one converts into failures. The asymmetry is the whole argument, and it applies to every timeout of this shape.

## 2026-09-21 · bug · roles/domain_member_retry — the member is fine, the path is not

**Symptom.** One fops member per cold build fails all three join passes:

```
fops-ops01 did not join fops.blackstone.mil in 3 passes.
Last locator probe: DCLOCATOR_NOT_READY no-srv-records-for-fops.blackstone.mil
  dns=[Ethernet1=172.31.3.11/172.31.3.12]   <- correct: fops-dc01, fops-dc02
  ip=[172.31.6.11,10.255.240.177]           <- correct: range + mgmt
```

**What is now ruled out.** Both ends were provably healthy. The DC-locator play added the same day printed, *before* the join plays ran:

```
fops-dc01 (fops.blackstone.mil): DCSRV_READY fops-dc01.fops.blackstone.mil
```

So the records existed and were resolvable from the DC. The member's resolvers and addresses were correct, and passes 2 and 3 re-applied both from `network_interfaces` and changed nothing, because nothing was wrong with them. Configuration is right at both ends. What is left is the path between them.

**Root cause (strongly indicated, not yet proven).** The members are on `172.31.5.x` / `172.31.6.x`; the DCs are on `172.31.3.x`. Every lookup has to route. `roles/init` documents an impostor MAC that answers ARP for the gateway address on whatever segment it appears on, **answers ICMP** so the gateway looks healthy, and — its words — *"presents as DNS failures, domain joins failing, Fleet enrolment failing."* That is this failure exactly.

Two things make a host reach the join plays unpinned despite init running the repair: init's own notes record entries reverting to the impostor MAC inside a single run with no reboot, and the task fails **open** when it cannot prove a probe target is off-subnet, which is correct behaviour — an unpinned gateway is the status quo, a wrongly pinned one is an isolated host.

**Fix.** The ARP repair is extracted to `roles/init/tasks/gw_arp.yml` and `domain_member_retry` includes it on join passes 2 and 3, alongside the IP and DNS re-application already there. It is idempotent; init runs the identical logic on every host every build.

**And the probe now settles it either way.** On `no-srv-records` it opens TCP 53 to each configured resolver and reports `resolver53=[172.31.3.11=UNREACHABLE ...]` or `=open`. Those are different faults with different fixes and have been indistinguishable until now: a resolver that cannot be reached is a routing or ARP problem, one that answers with no records is a DC problem. The next occurrence says which.

**Prior diagnoses of this failure, both wrong.** 2026-09-18 attributed it to herd load against a single DC; 2026-09-20 to the member's own network configuration. Each was disproved by the evidence the previous fix added — which is the only reason the search has narrowed rather than circled.

## 2026-09-20 · bug · site.yml — the DomainDnsZones partition is absent, not late

**Symptom.** The child PDC fails the partition gate on every cold build, regardless of how long the gate waits:

```
Probe said: DNSPART_NOT_READY zone ds=True scope=Legacy | partition-query-failed:
Failed to get Directory Partition information for DomainDnsZones.fops.blackstone.mil
on server FOPS-DC01.
```

**Root cause.** `Failed to get Directory Partition information` is the partition being **absent**, not merely un-enlisted on this server. The built-in DNS application partitions are supposed to be created during promotion and, for the child domain on this platform, are not. The zone therefore lands at `Legacy` scope in the domain NC, and `win_dns_zone` with `replication: domain` has nowhere to move it.

**Waiting does not work, and this was established the expensive way.** The ceiling was raised from 600s to 1200s and then to 2400s. The 2400s run cost 35 minutes of extra wall clock and failed identically. A state that never changes does not yield to a longer poll — the number was the wrong thing to tune, and two builds were spent learning it.

**Fix (upstream).** Promotion should create the built-in partitions. Where it does not, create them rather than wait.

**Workaround (overlay).** The gate probes for five minutes, then runs `dnscmd /CreateBuiltinDirectoryPartitions /Domain`, restarts the DNS Server service so it re-enumerates its partitions, and re-probes. `dnscmd` and not a cmdlet because there is no cmdlet for the **built-in** partitions — `Add-DnsServerDirectoryPartition` creates custom ones. The failure message now prints the before, the dnscmd output and the after, and says plainly that waiting longer will not help.

## 2026-09-20 · gap · site.yml — nothing made the DCs advertise themselves before the joins

**Symptom.** Two fops members per build fail all three join passes. Their configuration is provably correct:

```
DCLOCATOR_NOT_READY no-srv-records-for-fops.blackstone.mil
dns=[Ethernet1=172.31.3.11/172.31.3.12]      <- fops-dc01, fops-dc02: correct
ip=[172.31.5.82,10.255.240.144]              <- range + mgmt: correct
```

**Root cause.** The records they were looking for did not exist. No play ever forced or verified DC locator-record registration; every join ran on the assumption that the DCs had advertised themselves, and on a fresh build that assumption is sometimes false.

**This invalidates the previous day's fix.** The 2026-09-20 repair added to `domain_member_retry` re-applies a member's declared IP and DNS on passes 2 and 3. It fired on both failing hosts, changed nothing — because nothing was wrong with them — and they failed anyway. Re-applying correct config cannot conjure a missing SRV record. The repair is kept: it is cheap, scoped to the failure path, and covers a real fault shape. But it was aimed at the wrong host, and only the probe output added the same day made that visible.

**Fix.** A play between the DNS forwarders and the join plays: `nltest /dsregdns` on each PDC to force immediate registration rather than waiting for the Netlogon timer, then `Resolve-DnsName -Type SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain>` with `until:`/40×15s to prove the records actually resolve. Forcing registration and having it succeed are different claims, so the gate tests the second one.

Failing here costs one task. Failing later cost fifteen members three join passes each, discovering the same fact one at a time.

## 2026-09-20 · note · airfield deploys clean — 86 hosts, zero failures

First fully successful cold build since the Splunk removal. Both domains promoted, users created, all four DCs enrolled in Fleet, every Fleet integration reporting data. Three attempts, 7h 55m wall clock, attempt 3 clean in 58m.

Attempts 1 and 2 still failed, for the causes below.

---

## 2026-09-20 · bug · site.yml dns gate — ten minutes is not enough for a new child domain

**Symptom.** The forest root builds; the child PDC times out on the partition gate:

```
TASK [Fail if the DomainDnsZones partition never enlisted]
fops-dc01 did not enlist the DNS application partition
DomainDnsZones.fops.blackstone.mil after 600s.
Probe said: DNSPART_NOT_READY zone ds=True scope=Legacy
```

**Root cause.** Not the gate logic — the gate was right. `scope=Legacy` means the zone is AD-integrated but still stored in the domain NC rather than an application partition, which is where a child-domain zone lands when DNS creates it before `DomainDnsZones.<child>` exists. `win_dns_zone` with `replication: domain` then has nowhere to move it to, which is the 2026-09-18 failure this gate was built to prevent.

The gate correctly refused to proceed. Ten minutes was simply short: the partition was present by the next attempt.

**Fix.** `dns_partition_retries` 40 → 160, a 40-minute ceiling.

The number is chosen against uncertainty, not against a measurement: the partition was absent at ten minutes and present by the next attempt, which began 5h27m later, so all we actually know is that the true figure lies somewhere in between. The asymmetry is what makes a generous value cheap. This is a **poll, not a sleep** — the probe runs immediately and again every 15s until the partition appears, then the gate exits, so a child DC ready in 30 seconds costs 30 seconds regardless of the ceiling. The only run that pays the full 40 minutes is one where the partition never arrives, and that run was going to fail anyway; it now fails having waited long enough for the failure to mean something.

The gate's failure message computes the figure from the variable rather than hardcoding it, so the two cannot drift apart.

## 2026-09-20 · bug · roles/domain_member_retry — the failure named the wrong host

**Symptom.**

```
TASK [domain_member_retry : Fail if bs-hq01 never joined blackstone.mil]
fatal: [bs-supply01]: FAILED!
```

The task name says `bs-hq01`. The host that failed is `bs-supply01`.

**Root cause.** The task name contained `{{ inventory_hostname }}`. Ansible renders a task name once per play, not once per host, so it froze on whichever host templated it first. A failure banner that names the wrong machine sends you to the wrong machine.

**Fix.** The name no longer names a host. The `msg` body still does, where it renders per-host and is correct.

---

## 2026-09-20 · gap · roles/domain_member_retry — the locator probe said what, not why

**Symptom.** `bs-supply01` failed all three join passes:

```
Last locator probe: DCLOCATOR_NOT_READY no-srv-records-for-blackstone.mil
```

Fifteen minutes of locator waiting across three passes and the SRV records never resolved. 28 of 29 hosts in the same play joined normally.

**What this tells us.** The 2026-09-18 diagnosis of this failure mode was herd load against a single DC. That was wrong, or at least not the whole story: this host could not resolve the locator records at all, which is a DNS fault on the host rather than a busy DC. The probe added on 2026-09-18 is what made the difference visible — the old blind join could not have distinguished them.

**Gap.** The probe named the symptom and nothing about the cause, so the next step was still a guess.

**Fix, part one — evidence.** On `no-srv-records` the probe now also reports the host's configured DNS servers per interface and its IPv4 addresses, so a host pointed at the wrong resolver or holding no production address says so in the failure itself.

**Fix, part two — repair.** Passes 2 and 3 now re-assert the network configuration the host declares in `network_interfaces` before probing again: the IPv4 addresses and the DNS servers, via the same two DSC resources `roles/common` uses, followed by a resolver-cache flush. A negative SRV lookup caches like any other, so without the flush the probe can keep returning the pre-repair answer.

This is deliberately on the failure path only. A host that joins on pass 1 never runs any of it, and the 28 hosts that were always fine pay nothing.

It repairs both shapes of the fault with one action, which matters because the evidence does not distinguish them: a production NIC that never took its static address cannot reach a DNS server at all, and one holding the wrong resolvers cannot resolve — and from the locator's side those look identical. DSC changes only what does not match, so re-applying correct config is a no-op.

**A correction to the record.** The 2026-09-18 entry attributed this failure mode to herd load against a single DC, and an earlier note here claimed nothing in the playbook sets member DNS. Both are wrong. `roles/common` applies IP, gateway and DNS from `network_interfaces` via `xIPAddress` / `xDNSServerAddress` long before the join plays — it simply does not use `Set-DnsClientServerAddress`, which is what a grep for the cmdlet missed. The fault is that the config does not survive or does not apply on one random host per build, not that it was never set.

## 2026-09-19 · bug · roles/create_users — waits for LDAP, then uses ADWS

**Symptom.** On a freshly promoted child DC, every `Create Users` item fails:

```
failed: [fops-dc01] (item={'name': 'simspace', ...}) => {"msg": "Unhandled exception while
executing module: Unable to find a default server with Active Directory Web Services running."}
```

Thirteen items, thirteen failures, and the host drops out of every play below — including Fleet enrollment, so the deploy dies much later at the Fleet coverage gate naming a host whose real problem was hours upstream.

**Root cause, part one — the gate tests the wrong service.** The role opens with a wait on `127.0.0.1:389`. Everything below it talks to **ADWS**, not LDAP: `microsoft.ad.user` and `microsoft.ad.group` both go through the AD PowerShell stack, as do the `Get-/Set-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy` calls. ADWS starts *after* AD DS, so port 389 answering proves something true and irrelevant. Same defect shape as 2026-09-03.

**Root cause, part two — the modules ask the locator for a DC.** `microsoft.ad.user` and `microsoft.ad.group` with no `domain_server` ask the DC locator for a default server. A freshly promoted DC cannot reliably locate *itself*. The role already knew this: the password-policy tasks pin `-Server $env:COMPUTERNAME` with a comment explaining exactly why (2026-07-14). The module tasks never got the same treatment.

**Fix (upstream).** Gate on ADWS, and pin every AD call to the DC the play is running on.

**Workaround (overlay).** A `Get-ADDomain -Server $env:COMPUTERNAME` probe with `until:`/40×15s after the LDAP wait, plus a `fail` task naming what to check. `$env:COMPUTERNAME` is then captured once and passed as `domain_server` to all four `microsoft.ad.user` / `microsoft.ad.group` tasks, matching what the shell tasks already do.

## 2026-09-19 · bug · roles/handlers — reboot ceiling too short for domain controllers

**Symptom.** Two DCs fail out of a run having rebooted perfectly well:

```
fatal: [bs-dc01]: FAILED! => {"changed": true, "elapsed": 608,
"msg": "Timed out waiting for last boot time check (timeout=600.0)", "rebooted": true}
```

`"rebooted": true` — the reboot worked. The handler simply stopped waiting.

**Root cause.** The shared `Reboot Windows` handler used `reboot_timeout: 600`. A member workstation is back in two or three minutes. A domain controller on its first boot after promotion has to bring up NTDS, Netlogon, ADWS and SYSVOL replication before it answers, and routinely takes longer than ten minutes.

**Fix.** 1800. This is a ceiling, not a delay — a host that returns in 90 seconds still takes 90 seconds — so raising it costs nothing and removes a whole class of false failure. The pre-promotion reboot in `roles/dcpromo` is raised to match, since a host that has just installed AD-Domain-Services may run servicing on the way back up.

---

## 2026-09-19 · bug · roles/dcpromo — the child-DC service probe ran on the forest root

**Symptom.** The forest root goes UNREACHABLE mid-play and leaves the deploy:

```
TASK [dcpromo : Confirm AD services are actually running on the new child DC]
fatal: [bs-dc01]: UNREACHABLE! => {"censored": "... no_log: true ..."}
```

**Root cause.** The task sets `ansible_user` to `<SHORTDOMAIN>\Administrator`, which is correct for a promoted child DC and wrong for the forest root. `microsoft.ad.domain` notifies the reboot handler, and handlers do not run until the END of the play — so within the play the forest root is promoted but **not rebooted**: local SAM gone, domain not yet serving. Connecting as `BLACKSTONE\Administrator` in that window returns UNREACHABLE.

The task had no `when:` at all, so it ran on both promotion paths despite being named, credentialed and written for one.

Compounding it: `until:` cannot retry an UNREACHABLE result and `failed_when: false` does not catch one, so the host left the play silently and the gate below it never got to report anything.

**Fix.** Guarded to the child path (`parent_domain_name is defined`, promotion not skipped) and given `ignore_unreachable: true` so an unreachable child DC is reported by the gate rather than vanishing.

---

## 2026-09-19 · bug · roles/dcpromo — microsoft.ad.domain installs AD-DS and promotes in the same task

**Symptom.** The forest root fails on every deploy.sh attempt, in minutes, and the range dies with it:

```
TASK [dcpromo : Create forest root domain (this host becomes first DC)]
fatal: [bs-dc01]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to install ADDSForest,
DCPromo exited with 15: Role change is in progress or this computer needs to be
restarted.\r\n", "reboot_required": true}
```

Three attempts, ~45 minutes total. With the forest root gone, nothing downstream of AD can build.

**Root cause.** `microsoft.ad.domain` auto-installs the AD-Domain-Services feature when it is missing, then runs DCPromo **in the same task**. DCPromo meets the role change the module itself just created and exits 15. The `reboot_required: true` in the response is the module reporting that it needed a reboot partway through and had no way to take one.

The child-domain path never hit this: it installs the feature explicitly first, then reboots if required, because `Install-ADDSDomain` needs the ADDSDeployment module on disk before it can be called at all. The forest-root path relied on the auto-install and had no equivalent step.

**Why it surfaced now.** Invisible for as long as the base image shipped AD-Domain-Services already present — the module had nothing to install, so nothing went pending and promotion worked. The first image without it took the forest root down immediately.

**Detection note — what does NOT work.** Probing for a pending reboot before the promotion task finds a clean host, because the pending state does not exist until the task runs. Measured twice on 2026-09-19: `win_feature` `reboot_required` reports were false and no pending-reboot registry key was present, while DCPromo went on refusing. Worth knowing before anyone tries that again. (If you do check those keys for other reasons: the Server Manager one is `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ServerManager\CurrentRebootAttemps`, misspelled by Microsoft and in a different hive from the obvious guess.)

**Fix (upstream).** Do not let `microsoft.ad.domain` install the feature. Install AD-Domain-Services as its own task, reboot if required, then promote.

**Workaround (overlay).** `Install AD-Domain-Services + management tools` now runs for **both** paths, ahead of either promotion, with its `parent_domain_name is defined` guard removed. A single reboot task follows it, firing when any feature install reported `reboot_required` or when the host is not yet a DC (`Win32_ComputerSystem.DomainRole` below 4). Hosts that are already DCs skip it, so re-deploys pay nothing.

## 2026-09-18 · bug · roles/mapped_drive — DSC GPLink has no -Domain/-Server, so it depends on the DC locator

**Supersedes the 2026-07-08 entry**, whose root-cause theory was wrong.

**Symptom.** On the child PDC only, every task in the role succeeds and the last one fails:

```
TASK [mapped_drive : Link GPO to OU]
fatal: [fops-dc01]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Failed to invoke DSC Set method: The specified
domain either does not exist or could not be contacted. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007054B)"}
```

`GroupPolicy` creates the GPO and eight `GPRegistryValue` tasks set its values, all on the same host, in the same play, over the same connection. Only `GPLink` fails.

**Detection.** It is wrapped in `block`/`rescue`, so it never appears as a deploy failure — the run is reported green with the GPO unlinked. Visible only by grepping the log for the task name.

**Root cause.** `0x8007054B` is `ERROR_NO_SUCH_DOMAIN`. The DSC `GPLink` resource exposes no `-Domain` or `-Server` parameter, so `New-GPLink` resolves the target DN's domain through the DC locator. On a child DC whose primary DNS was pointed at the parent PDC for promotion, that lookup is the thing that fails — not RPC, not GPMI, and not warm-up. GPMC itself is demonstrably fine, because everything above it in the role works.

**The 2026-07-08 theory is disproven.** That entry recorded this as a fresh-child-DC binding quirk curable by retrying "after fops-dc01 has been up for 15+ minutes". On 2026-09-18 it failed on attempts 2 **and** 3 of a deploy, the last roughly six hours in.

**Fix (upstream).** Do not use the DSC GPLink resource against a domain the host may not be able to locate. Call `New-GPLink` with `-Domain` and `-Server` pinned.

**Workaround (overlay).** The task is now a `win_shell` calling `Get-GPInheritance` / `New-GPLink` with both `-Domain` and `-Server` set to this host, which removes the locator from the path: the DC being configured is the DC being asked. Idempotency comes from checking `GpoLinks` for the GPO name rather than from DSC.

**Verified on the running range**, from the shipped tarball: the task created the link on `fops-dc01` and, re-run, reported it present with `changed=0`; `bs-dc01` stayed `changed=0` throughout, confirming the already-working domain was unaffected.

The `block`/`rescue` that wrapped this play in `site.yml` is **removed** — the fops play is now fatal, like the blackstone one. That wrapper existed so a failing link would not stop a deploy; what it actually did was hide the failure for two months while the run reported success. A convenience feature that silently does not exist is worse than one that stops the deploy and says so.

---

## 2026-09-18 · bug · roles/dcpromo — the AD-services probe reported the worst case as the best one

**Symptom.** None. The probe passed on hosts where the services did not exist.

**Root cause.** The probe counted services whose status was not Running:

```powershell
$svc = Get-Service ADWS, NTDS, Netlogon -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Write-Output ([string](($svc | Where-Object Status -ne 'Running').Count))
```

When `Get-Service` found **nothing** — the services absent entirely, which is what a failed promotion actually looks like — `$svc` was null, the filtered count was `0`, and `0` was the healthy value. A host with no AD at all scored identically to a fully promoted DC.

Combined with the duplicate-`when` defect logged above, the child-DC health gate was doubly inert: the condition was discarded, and the value it would have read was wrong.

**Fix.** Name each service, distinguish MISSING from Stopped, and emit a marker rather than a count. Retries added because the probe runs immediately after a reboot, where sampling once turns a slow NTDS start into a failure.

**Also fixed: the guard.** `Wait for the child DC to finish promoting and come back` and the gate both required `dcpromo_child is changed`. The promotion task reboots from inside its own session, so it can return unreachable or failed rather than changed — and those are exactly the runs where waiting and checking matter. Both now use `is not skipped`.

---

## 2026-09-18 · gap · requirements.yml documented an install that deploy.sh cannot use

**Symptom.** `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` fails with `couldn't resolve module/action 'pfsensible.core.pfsense_setup'` on a controller that deploys perfectly well.

**Root cause.** Neither the documented command nor `deploy.sh` passed `-p`, so collections land in `~/.ansible/collections` — per-user. `/tmp/deploy-script.sh` runs `deploy.sh` from system cron **as root**, so the deploy's collections live in `/root/.ansible/collections`, invisible to anyone checking by hand as `simspace`. The documented command additionally said `sudo`, which meant a hand-install landed somewhere the *non-root* path could not see either. Both halves worked only by accident of which account ran last.

**Fix.** Both `requirements.yml` and `deploy.sh` now install to `/usr/share/ansible/collections`, which is on the default search path for every user, with a fallback to the per-user default when that directory is not writable. `HTTPS_PROXY` is now overridable so the internal Nexus can take over without editing the script.

---

## 2026-09-18 · bug · roles/dcpromo — duplicate `when` silently deleted the AD-services gate

**Symptom.** None visible. That is the problem.

**Detection.** Ansible emits a construction warning on every run that loads the role:

```
[WARNING]: While constructing a mapping from roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml, line 290,
column 3, found a duplicate dict key (when). Using last defined value only.
```

One line on stderr, in the middle of a 26,000-line deploy log. It had been printing for months.

**Root cause.** The task carried two `when:` keys:

```yaml
- name: Fail if AD services did not come up on the new child DC
  ansible.builtin.fail:
    msg: |
      AD services are not running on {{ inventory_hostname }} after promotion.
  when: (child_dc_services.output[0] | default('9') | int) != 0
  when:
    - parent_domain_name is defined
    - dcpromo_child is defined
    - dcpromo_child is changed
```

YAML keeps the last key and discards the earlier one without complaint. The service condition — the entire reason the task exists — was never evaluated. The `Confirm AD services are actually running on the new child DC` probe immediately above it ran on every deploy and was read by nothing but the failure message.

Both lines are right there in the file and both are individually correct, which is what makes this class of defect survive review.

**Fix (upstream).** One `when:`, with the service condition as a fourth entry in the list.

**Workaround (overlay).** Applied directly; the role is copied into this repo.

**Prevention.** `verify_dup_keys.py`, wired into `build_tarball.sh` as a hard gate. `yaml.safe_load()` accepts duplicate keys silently, so neither `verify_shell_args.py` nor `verify_vars.py` could see this despite both parsing the file on every build. The new checker uses a loader that records duplicates instead of swallowing them, and was verified against the original defect rather than only against a clean tree.

**Still open, deliberately not changed here.** The surviving guard requires `dcpromo_child is changed`. That task fires an in-session reboot, so it typically returns unreachable and `is changed` evaluates false — meaning the gate stays skipped in exactly the case where a half-promoted child DC most needs catching. Widening it could newly fail deploys that currently pass, so it is a separate decision rather than a drive-by.

## 2026-09-18 · bug · roles/dns — AD-integrated zone task races the child domain's DomainDnsZones partition

2867   failed: [fops-dc01] (item=fops.blackstone.mil)   <- attempt 1, 48 min in
13886  ok:     [fops-dc01] (item=fops.blackstone.mil)   <- attempt 2
17701  ok:     [fops-dc01] (item=fops.blackstone.mil)   <- attempt 3
```

**Root cause.** `Install-ADDSDomain` creates the child zone, and the role then re-scopes it with `replication: domain` → `Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -ReplicationScope Domain`. The `DomainDnsZones.<child>` application partition is created and enlisted **asynchronously** after promotion. Until it exists, the re-scope has nowhere to put the zone and fails with that message.

The pre-existing child-ADWS gate does not cover this. ADWS is a different subsystem and answers minutes earlier — a gate has to test what the step behind it needs, not something adjacent to it (same lesson as 2026-09-03).

**Blast radius is the real cost.** A failed task ends the play for that host, so `fops-dc01` also dropped out of *every play below `dns`* — it received no `internal_dns_records`, never enrolled in Fleet, and the deploy failed 4 hours later at the Fleet coverage gate. Attempt 1 burned 4h 48m to fail on a race that resolves itself in minutes.

**Fix (upstream).** The role should not assume a freshly promoted DC can host an AD-integrated zone. Either gate on partition readiness or make the zone task retriable.

**Workaround (overlay).** Two layers:

1. `pre_tasks` on the `dns` play probe readiness with `until:`/40×15s, accepting **either** signal — the zone already being AD-integrated at Domain scope (in which case `win_dns_zone` is a no-op and cannot fail), **or** `DomainDnsZones.<domain>` present at `State 0`. Two independent signals because the gate is fail-closed: one property name that reads differently on some image would otherwise stall a healthy range for ten minutes and then fail it. A dedicated `fail` task reports what the probe saw and what to check.
2. `register`/`until: ... is succeeded`, 6×15s on both zone tasks in the role, absorbing the gap between "partition enlisted" and "DNS server accepts a re-scope against it".

## 2026-09-18 · bug · roles/domain_member_retry — joins blind, with no check that a DC is reachable

**Symptom.** On a cold build, a minority of members fail to join while the majority succeed on the same pass with the same variables:

```
fatal: [bs-hq02]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Computer 'bs-hq02' failed to join domain
'blackstone.mil' from its current workgroup 'WORKGROUP' with following error message:
The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted."}
```

3 of 29 `members_blackstone` hosts on 2026-09-18. The reboot-and-retry recovered one; two never joined, failed the Fleet coverage gate, and failed the deploy.

**Detection.** The 15-host `members_fops` play that ran immediately afterwards never entered the retry path at all (log 3428–3500). Same role, same credentials, fewer hosts.

**Root cause.** Two compounding factors.

*Concurrency.* Every member joins against a single DC — the second DC is promoted **after** both join plays — and `deploy.sh` runs 76 forks, so all 29 hit the DC locator simultaneously. "The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted" is what a member reports when the locator times out, not evidence of misconfiguration.

*No precondition.* The role attempted the join blind: try, and on failure reboot and try once more. A blind attempt cannot distinguish "the DC is busy" from "the DC is wrong", so it spent its one retry on a reboot that fixed nothing.

**Fix (upstream).** Probe before joining, and let a busy DC be waited for rather than failed on.

**Workaround (overlay).** The role is restructured around a per-pass `join_pass.yml`, included `domain_join_passes` times (default 3), every task guarded by `when: not member_joined` so passes short-circuit the moment one lands:

- **Locator preflight** before each pass — resolves `_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain>` and opens TCP 389, 88 and 445 to an advertised DC, `until:`/20×15s. This is precisely what the join needs, so a pass here means the precondition holds rather than resembling it. `nltest` would be the obvious tool but is not guaranteed present on every client image, so the probe is pure PowerShell.
- **Three passes instead of two**, with the reboot only from pass 2 on — rebooting before the first attempt would add ~5 minutes to every host on every deploy to fix a state that is almost never wrong.
- **`wait_for` delegated to localhost replaces `pause`.** Identical wall clock, but `pause` bypasses the host loop and is unsupported under `strategy: free`; with it gone, the join plays can be switched to `free` without the crash documented in `site.yml` and in PowerPlant's 2026-07-03 entry.
- **A `fail` task that names the last probe result**, distinguishing "no DC answered" (check DNS, SRV records, APIPA) from "DC answered but the join was refused" (check the credential and for a stale computer object).

On a healthy range the preflight returns on its first try and costs nothing.

## 2026-09-17 · gap · build_tarball.sh had no free-form shell-argument check

**Symptom.** Commit 5b91051 built and shipped cleanly with three odd-quote lines inside the gateway-ARP task's PowerShell comments. Those make the PLAY FAIL TO LOAD — not one task, the whole run, before any host is touched.

**Root cause.** Ansible runs `split_args()` over free-form module arguments and counts quotes; it does not know PowerShell has comments. An apostrophe in `bs-file01's gateway`, or a quoted phrase opened on one line and closed on the next, is an unterminated string to it. The file remains valid YAML and `verify_vars.py` accepts it happily — which is the point: the tree was being validated with a parser weaker than the one that would reject it.

**Detection.** Not here. `ss-pp-so` refused to build the identical text while airfield built it without a word. That repo has `verify_shell_args.py` wired into its tarball build and this one did not, so the same defect was fatal in one repo and invisible in the other.

**Fix (overlay).** Copied `verify_shell_args.py` from ss-pp-so and wired it into `build_tarball.sh` as a HARD GATE ahead of the archive step, matching ss-pp-so. Verified by reintroducing the exact apostrophe from 5b91051: the build now refuses with `odd quote count at line 9` and exits non-zero, and succeeds again once reworded.

Deliberately separate from `verify_vars.py` rather than folded into it: one validates variable references, the other validates that the play can be parsed at all, and they fail for different reasons.

## 2026-09-17 · bug · init gateway-ARP repair pinned a black-hole MAC and isolated a host

**Symptom.** A fresh deploy failed all three attempts on one host of 86. `bs-file01` could not reach Fleet on 8220, so the `elastic_agent` preflight failed it and no agent was ever installed. Its neighbour `bs-file02`, at the adjacent address in the same subnet with the same gateway, enrolled normally.

**Detection.** Comparing the two hosts' gateway neighbour entries:

```
bs-file01: 172.31.2.1 -> 00-00-00-00-00-00  Permanent
bs-file02: 172.31.2.1 -> 00-50-56-A8-E5-D7  Permanent
```

A Permanent entry holding the all-zeros MAC is a black hole that ARP can never re-learn past. **This was self-inflicted** — by the gateway-ARP repair ported from ss-pp-so on 2026-09-16, on its first cold-range run. It is strictly worse than the poisoning it exists to fix.

**Root cause, two compounding defects.**

1. *The validity test accepted a sentinel.* The guard was `if (-not $mac -or ($blocked -contains $mac))`. `00-00-00-00-00-00` is a non-empty string that is not on the blocklist, so it read as a real address. Windows returns exactly that MAC for an `Incomplete` neighbour — the state a failed re-probe leaves behind — so the script's own repair loop manufactures the value it then trusts.

2. *The routing proof did not prove routing.* `Routes` pinged the host's first configured DNS server, on the stated assumption that DNS "is off-subnet in every range these roles serve". False here: hosts in the Services segment (172.31.2.0/24) have their DCs in that same segment, so the ping never crossed the gateway. And `if (-not $dns) { return $true }` returned SUCCESS when there was nothing to test with. A proof that passes when it cannot run is not a proof — which is also why the post-pin rollback failed to catch the bad pin.

**Fix (overlay).**

- `Usable()` requires a well-formed `xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx`, rejects all-zeros and broadcast, and rejects blocklisted MACs.
- The probe target is verified to be genuinely off-subnet against the host's own addresses and prefixes, preferring `init_gw_probe_targets` (soc-syslog, soc-so-manager) over DNS. Subnet comparison right-shifts both operands by the host-bit count rather than building a mask with `[uint32]0xFFFFFFFF -shl n`, which PowerShell widens to int64 and gets wrong.
- **If no off-subnet target exists, the task does not pin at all.** Failing closed: an unpinned gateway is the status quo, a wrongly pinned one is an isolated host.
- A Permanent entry holding an unusable MAC is deleted at the start, so a host already damaged by the previous version heals itself on the next run.

**Remediation for a host already affected.** `Remove-NetNeighbor -IPAddress <gw> -Confirm:$false`, then re-probe. The new task does this automatically.

## 2026-09-16 · bug · so_fleet_integrations — the role creates and updates but never prunes

**Symptom.** `pfsense-bs-edge-fw` attached successfully and collected nothing: 20 retries of `observer.hostname:bs-edge-fw` returned zero documents, failing the deploy. `pfsense-bs-ops-fw` passed on the same run.

**Detection.** The symptom pointed at the firewall. It was not the firewall: `/var/log/remote/bs-edge-fw/syslog.log` held 873 `filterlog` lines out of 1552, so the device was logging, forwarding and reaching the collector normally. `syslog_source_ip_map` and `pfsense_interfaces` agreed on its sender address, and that address was in the relay's match list.

**Root cause.** `elastic_fleet_integration_check` matches by NAME, so renaming an integration does not replace the old one — it leaves it attached and RUNNING. `pfsense-firewalls` (one integration covering both firewalls, udp/9001) was superseded by `pfsense-bs-edge-fw` on the same port. Both existed, both claimed udp/9001, and the survivor was the old one — which has no `add_fields` processor, so its documents carry no `observer.hostname` and the per-firewall query matched nothing. bs-ops-fw on udp/9002 had no competitor, which is why exactly one of the two passed.

**Fix (overlay).** A prune step, `so_fleet_retired_integrations`, running BEFORE the attach. Order matters: when old and new bind the same listener port, leaving the old one in place means two inputs contend and the winner is arbitrary.

Deliberately an EXPLICIT list rather than "delete anything not in so_fleet_integrations". The same agent policy also carries the mirrored base integrations (system, osquery_manager, endpoint) and whatever SO's own loader placed there; a prune-by-exclusion would eventually delete something it did not understand.

**Wider point.** Renaming an integration is a destructive operation dressed as a rename, and it is silent until something contends for a shared resource. Any future rename needs an entry in the retired list in the same commit.

## 2026-09-16 · bug · pfSense Fleet relay — 29% of documents were grok failures, and none were attributable

**Symptom.** `logs-pfsense.log-default` held 133 documents: 94 parsed cleanly as firewall events, 39 with `event.kind: pipeline_error` and `"Provided Grok expressions do not match field value: [<78>Sep 16 19:44:00 /usr/sbin/cron[59995]: (root) CMD (/usr/sbin/newsyslog)]"`. No document carried `observer.hostname`, so with two firewalls writing one dataset there was no way to tell which had logged what.

**Detection.** Not by the deploy, which passed. The role's verify gate requires at least ONE document with `source.ip` present — a single genuine filterlog entry satisfies it while the rest of the dataset fills with errors. It asserts "something parsed", not "parsing is healthy". Found by dumping a document and reading it.

**Root cause, part 1 — the errors.** The relay matched on source IP and therefore forwarded EVERYTHING those firewalls emit. The pfSense ingest pipeline parses `filterlog` entries; cron, newsyslog and sshd messages fail grok by construction.

**Root cause, part 2 — the attribution.** pfSense omits the HOSTNAME field entirely (see 2026-06-30), so the message carries no identity. rsyslog works around that for the FILE store by mapping `$fromhost-ip` to a name — but the Fleet relay cannot, because `omfwd` to loopback means the Elastic agent sees `log.source.address: 127.0.0.1` for every message regardless of origin. Measured across all 133 documents. `observer.ingress.interface` is vmx0/vmx1 on both firewalls, so it does not disambiguate either.

**Fix (overlay).** Two changes to `29-fleet-forward.conf.j2`:

1. Relay only messages containing `filterlog`. Matching on `$rawmsg` rather than `$msg` deliberately — the messages are malformed RFC3164, so rsyslog's own field parsing of them is not something to depend on. The system messages are NOT lost; they continue to the per-host file rules in 30-remote.conf. Only the Fleet relay is narrowed.
2. One relay port per firewall (`so_pfsense_syslog_ports`), with one integration per port stamping `observer.hostname` via a static `add_fields` processor. The PORT carries the identity that the message cannot. Nothing rewrites the message, so grok parsing is untouched — which matters, because re-rendering is exactly what broke parsing before `%rawmsg%` was adopted.

Also made the role's verify query overridable (`verify_query`), so each firewall asserts `observer.hostname:<its own name>` rather than the default `<field>:*`. Without that, one silent firewall would pass on the other's data.

**Fix (upstream).** pfSense/FreeBSD syslogd should insert the local hostname on remote forwards. Until then the port is the only reliable carrier of device identity through a loopback relay.

## 2026-09-16 · bug · so_search / so_sensor — grid-join gate waited for a transition a healthy node never makes

**Symptom (as seen on ss-pp-so 2026-09-03, latent here).** Sensors fail grid join with `attempts: 30, cmd: salt-key --list=unaccepted, stdout: "Unaccepted Keys:"` — an EMPTY list — while their keys sit in Accepted on the master and the nodes serve traffic with Zeek and Suricata green.

**Root cause.** The gate polled `salt-key --list=unaccepted` and waited for the node's key to appear there. That is only correct on a FIRST install, where the key genuinely passes through Unaccepted on its way to Accepted. A node that is already a grid member never enters Unaccepted — it reconnects with the accepted key it already holds — so on any re-run against a working grid the gate waits five minutes for a transition that cannot happen, then fails a healthy node. The reboot above it carries no `when:` guard so it runs even when `so_setup_can_skip` is true, while the stale-key delete DOES carry that guard and is skipped: on a re-run the key is left in place ON PURPOSE, and the gate then demanded to see it somewhere it could never be.

**Why airfield had not hit it.** The range has only ever installed SO fresh. The 2026-09-15/16 deploy reached the SO phases for the first time on its third run, so the key genuinely passed through Unaccepted. The first re-deploy over an existing grid would have failed healthy nodes.

**Fix (overlay).** Wait for the END STATE — the master knows this key, in either list — and let `so-minion -o=add` accept it or no-op. The task below the gate already tolerated exactly this case (`"does not match any unaccepted keys" not in so_min_add.stdout`), so the gate was strictly stricter than the step it exists to protect. When a gate and the operation behind it disagree about what counts as ready, the gate is the one that is wrong.

## 2026-09-16 · platform · init — default-gateway ARP answered by an impostor MAC

**Symptom.** Off-subnet routing silently fails on Windows hosts. Presents as DNS failures, domain joins failing and Fleet enrolment failing — never as an ARP problem.

**Root cause.** One MAC, `00:50:56:98:7D:D7`, answers ARP for the default-gateway address on whatever segment it appears on. Observed on four subnets across three independent ranges, always Windows-only: Linux on the same wire ignores unsolicited ARP for an address it did not ask about (`arp_accept=0`) while Windows accepts the reply and overwrites its cache. **It answers ICMP**, so any check that stops at "can I reach my gateway" reports healthy while nothing routes off-subnet. It is in a different VMware MAC block (`:98:`) from every real router interface (`:A8:`), so only the platform vendor can remove the cause.

**A flush alone is not enough.** The impostor re-announces — hosts repaired by a flush reverted within the same run, with no reboot. The entry must be PINNED as a Permanent neighbour, which a forged reply cannot overwrite.

**Fix (overlay).** Ported from ss-pp-so: flush and re-probe until the learned MAC is not blocklisted, confirm an OFF-SUBNET host is reachable (the host's own DNS server — proving routing, not merely that the gateway answers), then write a Permanent neighbour entry, and roll it back if reachability breaks. Non-fatal: a host that cannot route fails a later precondition that reports it better than init can.

## 2026-09-16 · bug · deploy.sh — a clean retry-scoped pass reported success over an unbuilt range

**Symptom.** Attempt 1 failed, attempt 2 ran retry-scoped and passed, and deploy.sh exited 0 with `Success on attempt 2 (retry scope)`. The range had no domain joins and no Security Onion.

**Root cause.** The retry file lists the hosts that FAILED. Running the playbook limited to them repairs those hosts, but every play whose targets were dropped when they failed still has not run. On airfield 2026-09-15, bs-dc01 — sole member of `[pdc_blackstone]` — failed on an ADWS race in attempt 1, so `Create Users`, `dns` and BOTH domain joins lost their target and the SO phases never started. Attempt 2 scoped to bs-dc01 fixed bs-dc01, passed, and the loop `break`ed on that success. A repair was mistaken for a deployment.

**Detection.** Eric noticed the second attempt was suspiciously short, doubted that every play had run, and re-ran deploy.sh by hand — the full sweep then passed and built everything attempt 2 had skipped. Nothing in the script's output distinguished the two states.

**Reachable only since 2026-09-15.** Before the `RETRY_FILE` path was fixed the `-f` guard never matched, so attempt 2 was always a full sweep and "success on attempt 2" genuinely meant a full sweep had passed. Correcting the retry path opened this hole behind it.

**Fix (overlay).** The retry-scoped attempt is now a REPAIR PASS that never breaks out of the loop however well it goes. It reports `Repair pass clean — NOT declaring success`, clears the retry file and `continue`s, so attempt 3's full sweep is what actually confirms the range. This automates precisely the manual re-run that caught it.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · deploy.sh — no BOOT_DELAY on the largest range of the four

**Symptom.** On two consecutive fresh deploys (2026-09-14, 2026-09-15) not every VM had finished provisioning by the time the playbook reached `Init`. On the 14th that cost four Windows hosts, which under the then-current `any_errors_fatal: true` took all 48 out of the deploy.

**Root cause.** A defensive `sleep 120` was removed from deploy.sh on 2026-07-02 in a speed pass, reasoning that the retry loop already handles a VM that is not ready. ss-pp-so removed it for the same reason and **restored it on 2026-08-05 at 180s**, having found that the reasoning did not survive a fresh range — the retry loop does "handle" an unprovisioned host, but only by spending a full multi-hour sweep to discover it. airfield never got that restoration, and it is the LARGEST of the four ranges (86 hosts against 74/74/78) with the longest provisioning tail.

**Detection.** Comparing the four repos: airfield was the only one with `BOOT_DELAY=NONE`, and simultaneously the only one carrying the stale 2026-07-02 note claiming the delay was unnecessary.

**Fix (overlay).** `BOOT_DELAY="${BOOT_DELAY:-300}"` before the attempt loop — 300s rather than ss-pp-so's 180s because the range is larger. Placed AFTER the galaxy, platform-prerequisite and vault checks, so a broken tree or a wrong vault password still fails in seconds rather than after a five-minute sleep. Overridable with `BOOT_DELAY=0 ./deploy.sh`, which was the legitimate half of the 2026-07-02 argument.

Separately, `init_wait_timeout` raised 1800 -> 2400. These are different levers and are not interchangeable: BOOT_DELAY is flat wall clock paid once while the PLATFORM provisions, and covers hosts that do not exist yet — no IP, no NIC, nothing for `wait_for_connection` to connect to. `init_wait_timeout` is a per-host ceiling that costs nothing when a host is ready, because `wait_for_connection` returns the moment the connection succeeds. Raising the ceiling only became affordable once `any_errors_fatal` came off the Init play, since a host that exhausts it now drops out alone instead of taking the fleet with it.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · site.yml "Bootstrap simspace as fops.blackstone.mil Domain Admin" — raced ADWS on the freshly promoted child DC

**Symptom.** `Create simspace in the child domain` failed on bs-dc01 with `Get-ADUser : Unable to contact the server. This may be because this server does not exist, it is currently down, or it does not have the Active Directory Web Services running.` fops-dc01 had completed its own promotion play clean in the same run (`ok=27, failed=0`).

**Root cause.** `Get-ADUser` and `Get-ADDomain` do not speak LDAP — they talk to Active Directory Web Services on TCP 9389. ADWS starts AFTER AD DS on a freshly promoted DC, and after its post-promotion reboot. There is a window of minutes where the child DC is promoted, DNS resolves it and LDAP answers while ADWS still does not. The task had no wait and no retry: it assumed the child domain was serving the instant the play reached it.

**Why it cost the whole range.** bs-dc01 is the sole member of `[pdc_blackstone]`. When this task failed, bs-dc01 was marked failed and dropped from every subsequent play — `Create Users` (hosts: pdc), `dns`, and BOTH domain joins all target it. One transient race took out the forest root, and nothing downstream of AD could be built. The run got no further than the range baseline; the Security Onion phases never started.

**Fix (overlay).** A preflight gate ahead of the create step, same shape as `additional_dc`'s locatable-DC gate: retry `Get-ADDomain -Server <child>` until it answers (40 x 15s = 10 min), then fail with the reason if it never does. The probe deliberately uses Get-ADDomain rather than a TCP check on 9389 — it exercises the same ADWS path, the same credential and the same `-Server` target the create step uses, so a pass means the precondition actually holds rather than merely resembling it.

**Fix (upstream).** Anything that promotes a DC and then immediately uses an AD cmdlet against it needs this gate; promotion returning success is not the same as the domain being serviceable.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · Init play — `any_errors_fatal: true` turned 4 unreachable hosts into 48

**Symptom.** A fresh airfield-range deploy built the Linux side and the whole Security Onion grid, then failed 4.5 hours later at `75-endpoint`'s Fleet coverage check with all 48 Windows hosts missing. The recap showed 44 of them at `ok=2, changed=0, skipped=0, failed=0, unreachable=0` — they had completed init's two tasks and then been offered nothing else for the rest of the run. Four hosts showed `ok=1, unreachable=1`.

**Root cause.** The Init play carried `any_errors_fatal: true`. Under that flag an unreachable host does not fail alone: Ansible marks EVERY host in the play failed, aborts the play, and removes all of them from every subsequent play. Plays targeting other groups keep running, so the deploy does NOT stop — it silently continues without the entire Windows fleet. Four hosts that never finished booting inside init's `wait_for_connection` therefore cost 44 healthy hosts their AD join, their Sysmon install and their Elastic Agent enrolment. The Fleet assertion at the end was the first thing to notice.

**Detection.** Only visible by cross-reading the PLAY RECAP: `ok=2` with `skipped=0` and `failed=0` is the signature of a host that was silently dropped, not one that was skipped by a `when`. Fleet knowing exactly the Linux endpoints plus the SO grid, and nothing else, confirmed it.

**Fix (overlay).** Removed `any_errors_fatal: true` from the Init play. Unreachable hosts now fall out individually. A `run_once` report at the end of the play names the dropped hosts immediately — `ansible_play_hosts_all | difference(ansible_play_hosts)` — so the problem is visible in minutes instead of hours. The deploy deliberately CONTINUES: the reachable hosts are still built, and the end-of-run coverage assertions remain the hard gate. A deploy with missing hosts still fails; it just fails having done all the work it could, which is what makes the retry cheap.

**Why not fail immediately at init.** A fatal assertion there would report the problem better but still stop the deploy before any Windows work — reproducing the very failure being removed.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · deploy.sh — attempt 2 was never once retry-scoped

**Symptom.** Attempt 1 fails, Ansible prints `to retry, use: --limit @/etc/ansible/retry/site.retry`, and deploy.sh announces `=== Attempt 2 (full sweep) ===` instead of the retry scope.

**Root cause.** `RETRY_FILE="retry/$PLAYBOOK.retry"` with `PLAYBOOK="site.yml"` builds `retry/site.yml.retry`. Ansible strips the extension and writes `retry/site.retry`. The paths never matched, so the `[ -f "$RETRY_FILE" ]` guard was always false. That guard exists to handle "the deploy died before writing a retry file", so a missing file looked like a legitimate condition rather than a bug — it failed silently and safely, in the direction of doing more work rather than less, which is why it survived this long.

**Fix (overlay).** `RETRY_FILE="retry/$(basename "${PLAYBOOK%.*}").retry"`. Handles `.yml` and `.yaml` and any directory prefix.

**Scope.** The identical line was present in airfield-range, ss-pp-so, ss-pp-stacked and ss-pp-ab.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · Security Onion `so-setup` — seeds its container registry from ghcr.io

**Symptom.** Every container except `so-dockerregistry` stays `missing` and `so-status` never goes green. The local registry store at `/nsm/docker-registry/docker/registry/v2/repositories/security-onion-solutions` is empty or short.

**Root cause.** `so-setup`'s `docker_seed_registry()` pulls 22 images straight from `ghcr.io` on the manager. That made the SO nodes the only hosts in the range reaching the internet themselves — every other artifact class already came from the controller's nginx mirror. Worse, `so-setup` DELETES `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/` on its reinstall path, so the docker proxy drop-in `so_base` writes is gone by the time seeding runs; docker falls back to direct DNS, hits an in-range DC that cannot resolve `ghcr.io`, and every pull 404s. Observed on ss-pp-stacked 2026-09-05: registry left at 8.0K / 0 repositories, and because `setup-completed` had already been written the next two attempts SKIPPED `so-setup` entirely.

**Fix (overlay).** Use the mechanism `so-setup` already checks before any network call — the airgap-ISO path. The controller builds `registry.tar` + `registry_image.tar` with skopeo and serves them from the mirror (`roles/so_apt_mirror/tasks/registry_content.yml`, `templates/build_so_registry.sh.j2`); the manager stages them into `/nsm/docker-registry/docker/` before `so-setup` runs (`roles/so_manager/tasks/registry_seed.yml`). In-play systems now have zero internet dependency for images; the controller is the only host that reaches ghcr.io, and only to BUILD.

**Fix (upstream).** `so-setup` should accept a registry mirror URL rather than hardcoding ghcr.io, and should not delete the docker drop-in directory on reinstall.

---

## 2026-09-15 · bug · `so-setup` writes its completion marker before the registry is proven

**Symptom.** A deploy attempt that left the registry empty still wrote `setup-completed`, so the next two `deploy.sh` attempts skipped the 45-90 minute install and went straight to a 30-minute `so-status` wait they could never pass. 7h22m across three attempts, never retrying the one step that was broken.

**Root cause.** The skip decision asserted the marker and a Salt install. Both can be true with an empty registry — neither is the outcome the next step depends on.

**Fix (overlay).** `roles/so_manager/tasks/main.yml` now probes the registry repository count and folds it into `so_setup_can_skip`, and after `so-setup` returns it verifies the count against `so_registry_min_repos` and fails closed WITHOUT writing the marker — so the next attempt redoes the install rather than skipping it.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · `verify_vars.py` — could not see `group_vars/all/`

**Symptom.** 96 "referenced but not defined" warnings, most of them false. Every variable defined under `group_vars/all/` read as undefined.

**Detection.** Porting the Security Onion registry variables added 13 new warnings for variables that were demonstrably defined and loadable.

**Root cause.** Three parser defects, all fixed in `PowerPlant/ss-pp-so` and not yet carried across: `collect_defined()` used a non-recursive `glob("*.yml")` so it walked straight past the `group_vars/all/` DIRECTORY; the `set_fact` pattern did not accept the `ansible.builtin.` FQCN prefix; and the `vars:` block regex was greedy enough to swallow the whole `tasks:` section. A checker with known-bogus warnings trains you to skim past the real ones.

**Fix (overlay).** Re-copied `verify_vars.py` from `PowerPlant/ss-pp-so` wholesale. It is range-agnostic (takes a stage directory argument) and additionally adds ROLE-SCOPE checking — role defaults are role-scoped, and a play referencing one without including that role fails at run time. Warnings dropped 96 → 4, and the 4 survivors are genuine pre-existing items worth review: `dns_zone_replication`, `nat`, `out`, `pfsense_stale_gateways`.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · Ubuntu unattended-upgrades holds the dpkg lock at first boot

**Symptom.** Every apt task fails outright on a fresh controller; `deploy.sh`'s three attempts fire seconds apart and all three lose the same race.

**Fix (overlay).** `so_apt_mirror` and `so_base` wait for `/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend` to clear (60 x 10s), and `so_apt_mirror` masks the `apt-daily` timers plus the `unattended-upgrades` service and writes `20auto-upgrades` 0/0. The RUNNING job is deliberately never stopped — killing it mid-transaction risks a half-configured dpkg, which is worse than the lock contention it would fix.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · `additional_dc` retried promotion against an unchecked precondition

**Symptom.** Promotion fails with "a domain controller could not be contacted", AFTER the DNS Server role is installed — leaving a zone-less DNS server that answers every query with SERVFAIL, which is worse than the host being down.

**Fix (overlay).** `roles/additional_dc` now asserts the precondition first: it waits (40 x 15s) for `_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain>` to resolve and fails BEFORE promotion is attempted, so no zone-less DNS server is ever created.

## 2026-09-15 · bug · VyOS image ships a console device that is not a tty

**Symptom.** `serial-getty@ttyS0` restart-loops forever — one cycle per ~10s, roughly 200,000 junk messages a day into the central syslog store, burying real VyOS signal.

**Root cause.** The image ships `set system console device ttyS0 speed '115200'` but `/dev/ttyS0` is not a working tty on these VMs, so agetty exits with "not a tty" and systemd restarts it.

**Fix (overlay).** A play in `site.yml` deletes the console in CONFIG (not `systemctl mask` — VyOS regenerates unit state from its own configuration, so a mask is undone by the next commit) and stops the flapping getty so the fix takes effect without a reboot. Guarded by a check first, because VyOS errors on deleting an absent node.


**Historical domain names:** entries dated before 2026-07-02 reference `vcab.lan` / `flightops.lan` and OU groups `pdc_vcab` / `pdc_flightops` / `members_vcab` / `members_flightops` — these were **renamed to `blackstone.mil` / `fops.blackstone.mil` / `pdc_blackstone` / `pdc_fops` / `members_blackstone` / `members_fops` in the Blackstone rebrand on 2026-07-02** (see `[[project_blackstone_rebrand]]` memory). The technical content of every pre-rebrand entry still applies; only the domain/group labels changed. Don't edit those entries retroactively — the labels are preserved as historical fact.

## 2026-08-14 · bug · L3 `gre` mirror tunnel makes Zeek discard 100% of frames — AFFECTS so-ansible AND PowerPlant

**Symptom.** Security Onion's dashboard shows the four sensors contributing
~20k events total against 4.2M overall. Zeek is "healthy", the container has
43h uptime, packets are arriving, and there is no `conn.log`.

**Measured on soc-sensor-corp, same interface, same traffic, minutes apart:**

| capture | packets | not processed | conn records |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zeek -i tun0` (plain libpcap) | 5,390 | 0.37% | **583** |
| `zeek -i af_packet::tun0` | 841 | **100.00%** | **0** |

The running workers use `-i af_packet::tun0` (`lb_procs: 3`). Zeek had
produced **66 connection records in its entire lifetime** while 23,590,318
packets arrived on the tunnel.

**Cause.** `tc ... action mirred egress mirror` copies complete ETHERNET
FRAMES. The tunnel was plain `gre` — an L3 tunnel that carries IP only — so
the kernel strips the L2 header and `tun0` presents cooked-mode frames
(`DLT_LINUX_SLL`, confirmed by `file` on a capture). Zeek's AF_PACKET plugin
expects Ethernet and cannot parse them, so it counts every frame received and
processes none.

**Why it hid for the life of three projects.**

- **Suricata reads cooked capture natively.** `eve.json` kept rotating hourly
  and alerts kept flowing, so the sensor looked alive from every angle.
- **`60-verify` counted packets on `tun0`.** They were genuinely arriving.
  The check measured the TRANSPORT and reported it as the OUTCOME.
- **The container is `healthy`.** Zeek's own health check passes; parsing
  nothing is not unhealthy.
- **Cluster logs kept being written.** `broker.log`, `capture_loss.log` and
  `notice.log` rotate normally — and all but `notice` are on SO's own shipper
  exclude list, so the dashboard showed near-silence rather than absence.
- `capture_loss.log` reports `rcvd` climbing and `dropped: 1715` flat, which
  reads like a healthy capture. Zeek was receiving fine. It was parsing that
  failed, and that counter does not measure parsing.

**Fix.** `gretap` on both ends — L2 GRE, which carries the Ethernet frame end
to end and gives `tun0` a normal `DLT_EN10MB` interface:

```
router:  set interfaces tunnel tunX encapsulation gretap
sensor:  mode: gretap    mtu: 1462   # 1500 - 20 IP - 4 GRE - 14 Ethernet
```

Plus a task to delete a stale L3 `gre` device before `netplan apply` — the
link kind is fixed at creation, so netplan will not convert one in place, and
a leftover tunnel keeps working, keeps feeding Suricata, and keeps Zeek
parsing nothing.

Fixed at the tunnel rather than by overriding SO's salt-rendered `node.cfg`
to force plain pcap: this keeps SO on its intended `af_packet` + `lb_procs`
fanout path, and follows the same principle as not patching `soc.json` — make
the environment match what SO expects.

**New check in 60-verify.** Zeek's `conn.log` must be GROWING, with retries
across the hourly rotation boundary. The failure message names the two
commands that identify this class — the worker `stdout.log` "not processed"
percentage, and `ip -d link show tun0` reporting `gretap` — and states
explicitly that Suricata working is not evidence.

**SCOPE: THIS IS NOT AIRFIELD-ONLY.** so-ansible and PowerPlant/ss-pp-ab both
build the mirror with plain `gre` and both have the identical `60-verify`
blind spot. PowerPlant was declared green with three working mirrors and is
heading for customer sign-off; its Zeek connection data should be checked
before that happens. The one-line test on any sensor:

```
grep -vc '^#' /nsm/zeek/logs/current/conn.log
```

**Method note.** Four wrong causes preceded this one: the mirror (fine — `tc`
filters and `tcpdump` both proved it), Zeek being dead (healthy, 43h uptime),
checksum offloading (0 of 40 packets bad on the wire), and a missing file
read as a diagnosis. Each was a single signal promoted to a conclusion. What
resolved it was one controlled comparison — same interface, same traffic, one
variable — which is what should have been run first.

## 2026-08-13 · bug · WPAD PAC never marked 172.31.* DIRECT, so analysts could not open the SOC WebUI

**Symptom.** Analyst workstations cannot reach Security Onion at
`https://172.31.7.15`, on a deploy where `playbooks/70-analyst.yml` passed.

**Cause.** `roles/squid/templates/wpad.dat.j2` returned DIRECT for:

```javascript
isPlainHostName(host) || shExpMatch(host, "10.10.*") ||
shExpMatch(host, "172.16.*") || dnsDomainIs(host, ".{{ domain_name }}")
```

`172.31.*` is absent. The PAC came from a range whose whole estate was in
`172.16.x`; Blackstone's production estate is `172.31.0.0/16` and only the OT
chain is `172.16.x`. The `dns` role publishes a `wpad` record and Windows
auto-detects WPAD by default, so every analyst browser loaded this and sent
`https://172.31.7.15` to squid.

**Why it hid.** `dnsDomainIs(".blackstone.mil")` covers browsing BY NAME, so
ordinary intranet use works and nothing looks wrong. Only IP-LITERAL access
breaks — and the SOC WebUI is reached by IP deliberately, because
`so_web_access_type: IP` and the SO nodes are not AD-joined so they have no
DNS records.

**Why the check passed.** `70-analyst.yml` asserted with
`Test-NetConnection -Port 443`, a raw socket that does not consult proxy
configuration at all. It answered "is there a network path", which was true,
while the question that mattered — "what path does the browser take" — went
unasked. A test that cannot fail for the reason the user is failing is not a
test of that thing.

**Fix.** `shExpMatch(host, "172.31.*")` added to the DIRECT list. The
management plane (`10.255.240.0/20`) is deliberately NOT added: it must stay
invisible to scenario traffic.

`70-analyst.yml` now checks three layers instead of one:

| layer | question |
|---|---|
| `Test-NetConnection` | is there a network path |
| `[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.GetProxy()` | **what path would the browser take** |
| `Invoke-WebRequest` | does the WebUI actually answer over that path |

`DefaultWebProxy` reflects live WinINET/WPAD resolution, so layer 2 asks
exactly what the browser asks. `GetProxy()` returns the original URI when no
proxy applies, which is the DIRECT case.

**Generalisable.** Any range on `172.31.x` built from this squid role has the
same gap, and it only shows for IP-literal access. Worth fixing upstream so
the PAC lists the range's actual production supernet rather than one
inherited from whichever range the template came from.

## 2026-08-12 · bug · `common` never sets the Linux system hostname, so soc-splunk logged as `localhost` for the life of the project

**Symptom.** Found while attributing devices in Security Onion's new syslog
input, not by looking for it. The central collector had a `localhost` device
bucket with ~169k events and no `soc-splunk` directory at all:

```
$ ls /var/log/remote/
172.31.1.14  atc-radar  ...  bs-www  ...  localhost  ...  www.blackstone.mil
                                          ^^^^^^^^^  and no soc-splunk
```

A 45-second capture on the collector named a single ongoing sender:

```
$ tcpdump -i any -nn -A 'udp port 514' | awk '/ IP /{...} /localhost/{print src}' | sort | uniq -c
     33 172.31.7.19        <- soc-splunk
```

**Cause.** `roles/common/tasks/linux.yml` writes an `/etc/hosts` line naming
`inventory_hostname`:

```yaml
line: "127.0.0.1 localhost {{ inventory_hostname }}"
```

and nothing else. The **system hostname is never set** — each Linux host keeps
whatever its image booted with. That is usually correct, because the platform
sets it from the blueprint VM name, so the gap is invisible on every host
where the platform did its job. soc-splunk's image booted as `localhost`.

rsyslog stamps the system hostname into every message's HOSTNAME field, and
`30-remote.conf` files by that field, so 100% of that host's syslog landed
under `/var/log/remote/localhost/`.

**Why only this host.** The project ALREADY had a mechanism for this.
`roles/splunk-forwarder/templates/rsyslog-hostname.conf.j2` writes

```
$LocalHostName {{ inventory_hostname }}
$PreserveFQDN on
```

which forces rsyslog to stamp `inventory_hostname` no matter what the OS
hostname is. But the forwarder play targets `linux:!splunk:!so_all`, and
soc-splunk is excluded because it IS the indexer. It is the only Linux host
that both lacks that override and booted with a wrong hostname. The SO grid
is excluded too, but its nodes booted with correct hostnames, so nothing
showed.

Two mechanisms, each covering the other's gap, and exactly one host in the
blind spot of both.

**Why it went unnoticed for the life of the project.** The data was never
missing — it was in Splunk the whole time under a name nobody queried for. A
second SIEM reading the same directories is what surfaced it, because the
device list became something a human had to read rather than something a
dashboard aggregated away.

**What was NOT affected, contrary to a first reading.** Splunk's `host` field
was always correct. `roles/splunk/templates/inputs.conf.j2` sets
`[default] host = {{ inventory_hostname }}` explicitly, so events indexed on
soc-splunk have always carried `host=soc-splunk`. Only `serverName` inherits
the OS hostname, because `server.conf.j2` does not set it — that is instance
identity (Settings UI, `splunk_server` field, distributed-search peer name),
not event data. And on a fresh deploy even that is right: the `Common Role`
play runs at site.yml:157, the Splunk indexer play at 1125.

**Fix (overlay).** Two tasks at the top of `common/tasks/linux.yml`:

```yaml
- name: System hostname matches inventory
  ansible.builtin.hostname:
    name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
  register: common_hostname

- name: Restart rsyslog so forwarded messages carry the new hostname
  ansible.builtin.service: { name: rsyslog, state: restarted }
  when: common_hostname is changed
  failed_when:
    - common_rsyslog is failed
    - "'Could not find the requested service' not in (common_rsyslog.msg | default(''))"
```

The restart is not optional. rsyslog reads the hostname ONCE at startup, so
setting it without restarting leaves every subsequent message carrying the old
name until the next reboot — the fix would look applied and change nothing
observable.

**Fix (upstream).** Same two tasks belong in
`range-development-ansible/roles/common`. Every range built from that role has
this gap; it only shows when an image boots with a wrong hostname.

**Scope, stated honestly.**
- This fixes the SYSLOG path. Splunk's own `serverName` lives in
  `server.conf` and is set at install time, so soc-splunk's internal Splunk
  data keeps its existing label until Splunk is separately reconfigured.
- It MAY also resolve `bs-www` appearing as both `bs-www` and
  `www.blackstone.mil`, if that host's system hostname is the FQDN. Not
  verified — the split could equally come from a service setting its own
  name.
- It does NOT address `bs-ops-fw` arriving as `172.31.1.14`. pfSense picks a
  source address per route and the collector routes it by `$fromhost-ip`;
  that needs a `syslog_source_ip_map` entry, which is a separate change with
  its own blast radius on the Splunk path.

## 2026-08-11 (later 2) · bug · Roles were ported without the data file one of them reads

**Symptom.** Phase 10, ~40 minutes into a deploy, on the first run that ever
got past the controller-connection bug:

```
TASK [so_apt_mirror : Fail if the ETOPEN ruleset was not bundled with the tarball]
fatal: [ansible]: FAILED! => emerging.rules.tar.gz is missing from the mirror
because it was not bundled at /etc/ansible/rules/emerging.rules.tar.gz.
```

The role behaved exactly as designed — it named the file, the path, and the
reason downloading is not an option. Nothing was wrong with it.

**Cause.** `so_apt_mirror` was copied from `ss-pp-ab` on 2026-08-11 along with
six other roles. The 5.5 MB ETOPEN ruleset it reads was not, because it does
not live under `roles/` — it is a top-level `rules/` directory that
`ss-pp-ab/build_tarball.sh` stages and packs explicitly. Airfield's
`build_tarball.sh` had no mention of `rules` at all.

**Why every check passed anyway.** This is the uncomfortable part. The port
was verified four ways and all four were clean:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| 48 roles bundled, up from 41 | correct |
| tarball members, zero AppleDouble junk | correct |
| `site.yml` syntax-check from a CLEAN EXTRACTION | passed |
| staged-vs-`TAR_PATHS` divergence assertion | passed |

Every one of them asks about roles and playbooks. None asks whether a role's
DATA came with it. The `TAR_PATHS` assertion added earlier the same day is
specifically unable to catch this: it compares what was staged against what
gets packed, and this file was never staged, so there was nothing to diverge.

**Fix.**
- `rules/emerging.rules.tar.gz` copied in (md5 `9db1fd3b90e37ed10a8ef2d11bcaef42`,
  identical to PowerPlant's — it is the same upstream ET Open ruleset).
- `build_tarball.sh` stages `rules/` and adds it to `TAR_PATHS`.
- A `REQUIRED_PAYLOADS` declaration keyed on the bundled role:

```bash
declare -a REQUIRED_PAYLOADS=(
  "so_apt_mirror:rules/emerging.rules.tar.gz"
)
```

If the role is in the bundle and its payload is not staged, the BUILD fails in
two seconds naming both. Verified by hiding the file and re-running: the build
exits non-zero with the role name, the file, and why it cannot be downloaded.

**The generalisable lesson.** ROLES ARE NOT SELF-CONTAINED. A role that reads
from `/etc/ansible/<something>` outside its own directory has a dependency the
role-discovery walker structurally cannot see, because that walker follows
`roles:` blocks and `meta/main.yml` — neither of which mentions data. When
copying a role across repos, grep its defaults for absolute controller paths
and carry those too. Add each one to `REQUIRED_PAYLOADS` so the next person
gets a build failure instead of a deploy failure.

## 2026-08-11 (later 1) · enhancement · `so_subnet_security` is a range-specific name in a range-agnostic role

**Symptom.** Copying the SO roles into a range whose grid does not live on a
subnet called "security" gives `'so_subnet_security' is undefined` in three
places, all of which fail late:

```
roles/so_base/tasks/main.yml:232          NO_PROXY for salt's HTTP probes
roles/so_base/tasks/main.yml:277          scope-link netplan route on the prod NIC
roles/so_manager/templates/manager.env.j2:83   ALLOW_CIDR in the answer file
```

The name is inherited from so-ansible's dev range and PowerPlant, where the SO
grid genuinely sits on a subnet named `security`. Here it sits on SOC.

**Why it is worth a note rather than a rename.** The variable is doing three
different jobs that happen to take the same value in both ranges so far:

| use | what it actually means |
|---|---|
| `ALLOW_CIDR` | who may reach the SOC WebUI |
| scope-link route | the subnet the grid's peers are on |
| `NO_PROXY` | node-to-node traffic that must not be proxied |

Those are the same CIDR only because the whole grid is on one subnet. Split a
grid across two subnets — a sensor in a DMZ, say — and one variable cannot
express all three, and the failure would be a silent proxy hairpin rather than
an error.

**Workaround (overlay).** `group_vars/all/security_onion.yml` defines
`so_subnet_security: "{{ so_subnet_soc }}"` with the three uses documented
inline. The roles stay BYTE-IDENTICAL to `ss-pp-ab`, so the next re-copy is a
plain `cp -R` with no merge to reconcile.

**Fix (upstream).** Rename to `so_grid_subnet` in the roles and split
`ALLOW_CIDR` out into its own variable, since "who may log in" is a policy
question and the other two are topology. Do it in so-ansible first, then
re-copy to both ranges together.

## 2026-08-11 · bug · `group_vars/vault.yml` mapped to a group that does not exist — all 7 vault vars were never loaded

**Symptom.** None. That is the entire problem. Every deploy of this range has
succeeded without ever loading a single `vault_*` variable.

**Detection.** Found while auditing `group_vars/` against inventory groups
before adding `group_vars/all/security_onion.yml` — not by anything failing.
A `group_vars/<name>.yml` file applies to hosts in the group `<name>`. There
is no `[vault]` group in `hosts`, and there never was:

```
$ grep -c '^\[vault\]' hosts
0
```

So `group_vars/vault.yml` was scoped to the empty set. `group_vars/power.yml`
has the same defect (no `[power]` group) but is currently harmless — no power
hosts are in the blueprint yet.

**Why it stayed invisible.** `group_vars/fuel.yml` references the vault vars
through `| default(...)` fallbacks:

```yaml
fuxa_admin_password: "{{ vault_fuxa_admin_password | default('...') }}"
```

Those defaults are what has actually been deploying the fuel farm this whole
time. The vault was decorative. Had any consumer referenced a vault var
*without* a default, this would have surfaced on day one as an undefined-
variable error — the defaults converted a hard failure into a silent
substitution.

Note the interaction with the 2026-08-10 (later 3) entry below: the file was
simultaneously shipping in plaintext *and* not being read. Fixing only the
encryption would have left the second half of the bug in place, and fixing
only the scope would have started loading credentials that were in the clear.

**Fix.** `git mv group_vars/vault.yml group_vars/all/vault.yml` (and
`group_vars/all.yml` -> `group_vars/all/main.yml`, since `all.yml` and `all/`
cannot coexist). Under `group_vars/all/` the file loads for every host.
`deploy.sh`'s vault guard follows to the new path.

**Verify after any group_vars move** that every file maps to a real group:

```
$ for f in group_vars/*.yml; do n=$(basename $f .yml); \
    grep -q "^\[$n\]\|^\[$n:" hosts || echo "ORPHAN: $f"; done
```

`all.yml` is the one legitimate exception. Anything else this prints is dead.

---

## 2026-08-10 (later 3) · bug · `group_vars/vault.yml` was shipping PLAINTEXT inside the tarball

**Found while answering a question about boot delays**, not by looking for it.

```
group_vars/vault.yml            -> PLAINTEXT
ansible.cfg vault_password_file -> /home/simspace/.vault_pass   (never created)
in ab_mb.tgz                    -> yes
deploy.sh vault guard           -> none
```

Seven credentials in the clear — `vault_simspace_password`,
`vault_openplc_admin_password`, `vault_fuxa_admin_password`,
`vault_influxdb_admin_token`, `vault_mqtt_password`, and both DB passwords —
distributed in every tarball, while `ansible.cfg` was configured as though the
file were encrypted. Nothing would ever have reported it: with the file in
plaintext, Ansible never needs the password, so the missing `.vault_pass` was
silent too. Two settings that only make sense together, neither checking the
other.

This is exactly the condition PowerPlant's fail-closed guard exists for. Its
comment reads *"a plaintext vault would have shipped silently"* — and here it
did, because that guard was never ported.

**Fix.**
- `group_vars/vault.yml` encrypted (AES256), password `simspace1`, matching the
  PowerPlant / so-ansible convention so one dev password covers all three
  ranges. Round-tripped before committing: all 7 keys recover.
- `deploy.sh` gains PowerPlant's fail-closed guard plus the unattended
  prerequisites (retry-dir ownership, `.vault_pass` ownership/mode via
  `sudo -n`).

**Three fatal checks, all exercised locally before shipping:**

| case | result |
|---|---|
| encrypted vault + readable password file | exit 0, one line of output |
| encrypted vault + MISSING password file | exit 1, names the blueprint's responsibility |
| PLAINTEXT vault | exit 1, refuses to ship credentials |

**deploy.sh now handles the password file itself** (2026-08-10, later 4).
These deploys are blueprint-driven with nobody at a keyboard, so "the blueprint
must place this file" is a defect rather than documentation. `deploy.sh`:
- creates `/home/simspace/.vault_pass` if absent, mode 0600, owned by the
  ansible user, from `VAULT_PASS_VALUE` (default `simspace1`, env-overridable);
- RESPECTS a pre-existing file — the airfield controller image ships one baked
  in, and it is never overwritten;
- **proves the password actually decrypts the vault** before running anything.

That last check is the important one. Existence, readability and non-emptiness
are all satisfiable by a WRONG password, and a wrong password fails much later
as an opaque parse error on the first vaulted variable — which reads as a YAML
problem, not a credential one. The image's baked-in secret and the password
this repo was encrypted with are two independently-set values with no reason to
agree; nothing but this check would notice.

**The trade, recorded so nobody rediscovers it.** The password now ships inside
`ab_mb.tgz` beside the encrypted vault, so anyone holding the tarball can
decrypt it. What encryption still buys is narrower but real: credentials stay
out of the repo, out of `git log`, and out of a casual grep of a checkout. It
is NOT protection against someone with the artifact. Revisit when the tarball
moves to the in-platform Nexus, where the platform can inject
`VAULT_PASS_VALUE` as a real secret and the default should be removed.

**Four cases exercised locally** (with `as_root` and `ansible-vault` stubbed so
the logic ran without root): absent -> created 0600 and decrypts; re-run ->
idempotent; pre-existing WRONG password -> refuses with a named cause;
pre-existing CORRECT password -> respected untouched.

**Not done: the boot delay.** The question that surfaced this was whether to
port PowerPlant's `BOOT_DELAY`. No — airfield's `init` already waits
`timeout: 1800`, against PowerPlant's 60s, so a slow boot is already absorbed.
A host silent after 30 minutes is not booting slowly, and none of today's
failures were timing.

**Status: VERIFIED** for the guard logic (three cases exercised) and the
encryption round-trip; the blueprint dependency is **OPEN** until
`.vault_pass` is placed.

## 2026-08-10 (later 2) · bug · ROOT CAUSE — `Install-ADDSDomain` used `-NoRebootOnCompletion` and a handler that cannot authenticate

**This is the defect. Everything else in today's log was treating its symptom.**

Attempt 1 on a CLEAN range:

```
TASK [dcpromo : Create child domain (this host becomes first DC of fops.blackstone.mil)]
changed: [fops-dc01]

RUNNING HANDLER [handlers : Reboot Windows]
fatal: [fops-dc01]: UNREACHABLE! => {"msg": "ntlm: the specified credentials
  were rejected by the server", "rebooted": false, "unreachable": true}
```

`Install-ADDSDomain` **succeeded**. The reboot that finalizes it never
happened — `"rebooted": false`.

**Why.** The task passes `-NoRebootOnCompletion` and delegates the reboot to
`notify: Reboot Windows`. But `Install-ADDSDomain` sets the machine's Primary
DNS Suffix and domain hint as part of its work, so from that moment unqualified
NTLM is rejected. The handler runs after the task's WinRM session closes,
cannot authenticate, and gives up. The promotion is written to disk and never
finalized — which is precisely the half-joined state
`dcpromo_child_heal` exists to clean up.

**So the range half-joins on EVERY deploy, by construction.** Three ranges on
2026-08-10, each losing 1.5+ hours, each "recovered" by healing a machine that
was going to break again on the next run. The heal role is a bandage over a
reboot that never fires.

**Fix.** Reboot from inside the session that is still authenticated:

```powershell
& shutdown.exe /r /t 15 /f /c "dcpromo: finalizing child-domain promotion"
```

fired immediately after `Status -eq 'Success'`, and `notify: Reboot Windows`
removed. `shutdown.exe` schedules a detached system process decoupled from
WinRM — the same technique `dcpromo_child_heal` already uses, documented there
because `Start-Job` children die with the parent shell.

Added afterwards: a `wait_for_connection` and an AD-services check using
`FOPS\Administrator` (the former local Administrator, now the child domain's).
Both fatal. If that credential is wrong we want to know at the promotion, not
three plays later when the bootstrap play reports "ADWS not running" — which
reads as a service problem rather than an auth one.

**The shape, for the third time today.** A step that invalidates the
credentials the NEXT step needs:
- `Install-ADDSDomain` -> reboot handler  (this entry)
- half-joined host -> heal role's default-creds probe  (entry above)
- unreachable probe -> `is succeeded` gate  (entry above)

Each one was written as though the environment after an action is the same as
before it. When an action changes authentication, everything downstream of it
in the same play needs credentials chosen for the AFTER state.

**Status: PROPOSED** — the reboot fix is high confidence; the
`FOPS\Administrator` credential for the post-reboot wait is reasoned, not
observed, and will fail loudly if wrong.

## 2026-08-10 (later) · bug · `is succeeded` does not mean reachable — my own fallback gate skipped every fallback

**Symptom.** After fixing the probe ORDER, attempt 3 still ran only three tasks:

```
MACHINE\simspace  -> UNREACHABLE ...ignoring
Pick which credential succeeded -> ok
Detect half-join state -> UNREACHABLE (fatal)
fops-dc01 : ok=2 unreachable=1 skipped=2 ignored=1
```

`skipped=2` is the tell: both credential fallbacks were skipped.

**Cause — mine.** The gate was `when: heal_local_ping is not succeeded`. In
Ansible an unreachable-but-ignored result has **`failed: false`**, so
`is succeeded` PASSES. The `succeeded` / `failed` tests describe task failure
and say nothing about reachability. The condition therefore evaluated false and
the role walked past both fallbacks into a task using credentials that could
not work.

I had just written the entry above about a repair routine whose first action
requires the thing being repaired, then gated its alternatives on a test that
cannot detect the failure mode in question.

**Fix.** Test reachability explicitly —
`heal_x.unreachable | default(false)` and `heal_x.failed | default(false)` —
and default to `true` when computing success so an undefined (skipped) probe
never counts as reachable.

**A NEW state, worse than half-joined.** The diagnostic snapshot from bs-dc01
shows fops-dc01 is no longer merely half-joined:

```
(Get-ADForest).Domains  -> blackstone.mil ONLY   (no child domain)
CrossRefs               -> no FOPS entry
DNS                     -> `fops NS` delegation DOES exist
fops-dc01 LDAP :389     -> UP
DsBindWithCred          -> failed with status 5 (access denied)
Get-ADUser -Server fops.blackstone.mil -> ADWS not running
```

It promoted far enough to LOSE its local SAM — `MACHINE\simspace` is now
rejected, which was not true before — and to serve LDAP, but never registered
the domain in the forest, and ADWS is down. The role's three probes are all
local-SAM or parent-domain; none can reach a machine whose only accounts live
in a child directory that is not yet in the forest. A fourth probe
(`FOPS\Administrator`) is added, though whether that directory will
authenticate at all with ADWS down is unproven.

**Recommendation recorded: do not keep healing this host.** Each attempt has
moved it into a state further from both "clean" and "promoted", and the
recovery surface grows each time. A fresh range costs ~5 minutes; the fixes
here make the NEXT promotion recoverable, which is the durable win.

**Status: PROPOSED** — the reachability fix is a clear correction; the
child-domain probe is untested and may not help in this particular state.

## 2026-08-10 · bug · `dcpromo_child_heal` could only ever run its first task — and that task uses the credentials it exists to repair

**Symptom.** A clean airfield deployment failed all three attempts:

```
fatal: [fops-dc01]: FAILED! => {"elapsed": 1832,
  "msg": "timed out waiting for ping module test: ntlm: the specified
          credentials were rejected by the server"}
```

Attempt 1 got `fops-dc01` to `ok=24 changed=15` then `unreachable=1`; attempts
2 and 3 died in `init` after 30 minutes each. Total cost: ~1.5 hours of a
deploy to a single host.

**State on the machine, read from the console** (Ansible could not reach it):

```
Domain: fops.blackstone.mil   PartOfDomain: True
ADWS / NTDS / Netlogon:       all Stopped
```

That is precisely the HALF_JOINED state `dcpromo_child_heal` was written for
(UPSTREAM_FIXES 2026-07-13). The role's diagnosis and its repair path are both
correct.

**It never got to run them.** The log shows exactly one task per attempt:

```
TASK [dcpromo_child_heal : Try to reach on default (unqualified simspace) creds]
fatal: [fops-dc01]: UNREACHABLE! ...ignoring
PLAY [Init] ...
```

Two things combine:
1. The role probed with DEFAULT unqualified `simspace` FIRST — the exact
   credentials broken in the half-joined state, because Windows prefixes the
   username with the machine's now-bad domain hint. The probe is guaranteed to
   fail in the only state the role acts on.
2. `hosts: pdc_fops` contains ONE host. `ignore_unreachable: true` does not
   keep a play alive when its sole host is unreachable — the play ends and
   `init` runs next. The three credential fallbacks below the probe were
   unreachable code on every real failure.

The role had `MACHINE\simspace` and `MACHINE\Administrator` fallbacks written
specifically for this, and could not reach either.

**Fix.** Probe with credentials that work in the states the role acts on.
`MACHINE\simspace` resolves to the local SAM on BOTH a clean (WORKGROUP) host
and a half-joined one, bypassing the broken domain hint. It fails only on a
genuinely promoted DC — the one state where we want to no-op anyway. Order is
now:

1. `MACHINE\simspace`  (clean + half-joined)
2. `MACHINE\Administrator`  (dcpromo resets this to domain_admin_password)
3. default unqualified  (already-promoted DC, or clean)

then state detection and heal as before.

**The general shape, worth carrying.** A repair routine whose first action
requires the thing being repaired cannot work. Same family as the
"self-blessing marker" and "guard blocks its own remediation" entries in the
so-ansible log — but sharper, because here the working alternatives were
already present and simply out of reach.

**Also relevant:** single-host plays have no partial-failure mode. This is the
second time that has cost a run — PowerPlant's `so-firewall` play died the same
way (ss-pp-ab UPSTREAM_FIXES 2026-08-04 later 11).

**Status: VERIFIED** — 2026-08-10, run against the stuck range:

```
fops-dc01 : ok=13  changed=3  failed=0
```

Thirteen tasks instead of one. `changed=3` is the repair itself — parent-forest
metadata cleanup on bs-dc01, local domain-hint reset, reboot. The role's final
task is a `win_ping` on DEFAULT unqualified credentials with no
`ignore_errors`, so `failed=0` proves the host now authenticates the way `init`
requires; it is a real assertion, not a report.

## 2026-08-10 · bug · build_tarball shipped ~50% AppleDouble junk (same defect as ss-pp-ab and so-ansible)

`ab_mb.tgz` was **836 members with 418 junk** — one `._name` companion per real
file. Apple's `tar` emits AppleDouble for any file carrying an extended
attribute, and `com.apple.provenance` is set on anything downloaded.

`--no-xattrs`, which this script carried, does nothing for it. `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1`
is the load-bearing setting. Measured 2026-08-07 on a directory with one
xattr'd file: plain tar 2 junk, `--no-xattrs` 2 junk, `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` zero.

It hides because Apple's `tar -tzf` MERGES AppleDouble members back into xattrs
when listing — a macOS `tar -tzf | grep '\._'` reports 0 against an archive
that is half junk. **Verify archive contents with `python3 tarfile`.**

Fixed with `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1`, `--exclude` for both patterns, and a
whole-stage `find -delete`. Now 418 members, 0 junk.

Note `tar -xzf` is ADDITIVE on the controller: every junk file shipped so far
persists in `/etc/ansible`, as does anything ever shipped and later deleted.

**Status: VERIFIED** — measured before and after with a tool that can see the
difference.

## 2026-07-20 · bug · roles/fuel_sim/files/fuelsim/physics.py — totalizer arithmetic `float & int` TypeError silently kills physics tick 1

**Symptom.** User asks "why do tank levels + header pressure never change?" — Grafana shows T-101/T-102/T-103 pinned at their initial fills (90/82/78 %) for hours, header pressure flat at 20 psi. Truck queue advances (`R-01 DISPENSING`, `R-02 LOADING`, ...), audit-DB rows accumulate, ST interlocks show PERMITTED — everything looks alive except sensor values.

**Diagnostic trail.**
1. Rate-check probe: `P202_RUN_CMD` True 120/120 samples over 60s (pump 2 commanded on the whole time) but `LR2_FLOW = 0/120`. So state_machine sets pump-run coils correctly, but physics never observes them → no drain, no pressure boost.
2. Header-pressure probe: `HEADER_PRESS` = 200 (0.1 psi units = 20.0 psi = base only, `running_pumps = 0`) — constant for 10s. Physics.tick's formula is `20 + running × 15`, so this proves physics is either dead or writing a constant value.
3. Full state snapshot during an active load: ALL interlock inputs True (valve=1, ground=1, deadman=1, overfill=0, src_tank=1, ESD=0, T101_LO=0, outlet=1), but `P201_RUN_STS = 0` (the DI physics writes back from `p1_actually_runs`). So `_interlock_ok()` was somehow returning False — impossible per the observed inputs.
4. Added a conditional `log.warning("LR1 blocked: ...")` at the point where the interlock decision is made. Redeployed. Log was silent → the conditional branch never executed → physics tick isn't running the code.
5. Added an unconditional heartbeat `log.warning("physics heartbeat: tick_ctr=%d", ...)` + wrapped `_tick(...)` in `try/except log.exception; raise`. Redeployed. Heartbeat never fired but the try/except caught the exception:
   ```
   TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'float' and 'int'
     File "/opt/fuelsim/bin/physics.py", line 232, in _tick
       (physics.racks[1].totalizer_gal + flow_lr1_gal) & 0xFFFFFFFF
   ```

**Root cause.** `flow_lr{1,2}_gal = physics.rack_flow_gpm * (dt_s / 60.0)` is a float (even at flow_gpm=0 → `0.0`). `physics.racks[1].totalizer_gal + flow_lr{1,2}_gal` → float. Then `float & 0xFFFFFFFF` → TypeError. The `int()` cast in the old form `int((tot + flow) & 0xFFFFFFFF)` applied to the *result* of the `&` — but the `&` never runs because the operands are wrong-typed. Fires on every tick, including the first (before any flow).

**Why nobody noticed for four days.** asyncio's `gather(return_exceptions=True)` at shutdown silently swallows unhandled task exceptions. During runtime, a dead coroutine just… stays dead; no message ever hits the journal. state_machine kept running as a separate coroutine, kept advancing the replay, kept writing coil/HR values that FUXA/Telegraf polled and showed on the HMI. Every downstream observer thought the sim was working. The only tell was that sensor timeseries never changed — but with tank capacities of 500,000 gal (INT-percent resolution = 5,000 gal/tick), that would have been hard to distinguish from realistic slow drawdown anyway.

**Fix (overlay).** Move the `int()` cast *inside* the `& 0xFFFFFFFF`:
```python
physics.racks[1].totalizer_gal = int(physics.racks[1].totalizer_gal + flow_lr1_gal) & 0xFFFFFFFF
physics.racks[2].totalizer_gal = int(physics.racks[2].totalizer_gal + flow_lr2_gal) & 0xFFFFFFFF
```
Now: int of the float sum → int, then `int & int` → int. Assigned back to `totalizer_gal`, which was already typed as int in `RackState`.

**Hardening (kept permanently).** Wrapped `_tick(...)` in try/except that calls `log.exception(...)` before re-raising. The exception still exits the coroutine (correct behavior — a broken tick shouldn't silently mask), but now a traceback lands in the journal on the *first* failing tick instead of getting swallowed until process shutdown. This would have caught the July-16 issue in seconds instead of four days.

**Related.** The 2026-07-16 `fuel_rw` sequence-USAGE grant fix (entry above) had regressed on the range (fuel_db redeploy dropped/recreated grants without re-running the sequence-privs task). That was fixed in the same redeploy cycle and is why the state_machine's `_on_load_end` warnings about "no open load in memory" also stopped: the old service instance was crashing DB inserts in the middle of `_on_load_start`, leaving `open_loads` unpopulated. Fresh service + fresh grants = clean state.

**Follow-up.** Consider tightening tank-level Modbus reporting to decipercent (INT × 0.1 %) or per-mille so slow drawdowns are visible on the Grafana panel resolution without needing to wait hours.

## 2026-07-20 · bug · roles/fuel_plc/files/fuel_farm.st — ST interlock logic bound to unbound %IX0.x / %IW0-9 (always zero)

**Symptom.** After the 2026-07-17 slave-device fix landed the fuelsim mirror at Modbus DI 800+ / IR 100+, FUXA and Telegraf were rewired to poll those higher addresses and started rendering live values. But the ST program itself continued to declare `LR1_GROUND_OK AT %IX0.2`, `T101_LEVEL AT %IW0`, etc. — OpenPLC's *own* DI 0-10 / IR 0-9 memory, which is unbound to any physical or slave-polled IO on our software-only PLC. So the interlock logic (`LR1_PERMIT`, `LR2_PERMIT`, ESD latch) always saw zeros: `GROUND_OK=False`, `DEADMAN=False`, `OVERFILL=False`, `T101_LO_LVL=False`, `ESD_ACTIVE=False`. Interlocks were effectively no-ops — permissive checks always False (blocking load-valve TRUE, which was already the default), ESD trip never triggered. The visible readouts on the HMI were fine (FUXA polled the slave mirror directly), but the ST program running inside OpenPLC was doing symbolic math on empty inputs.

**Why the naive fix was risky.** The obvious fix — rebind everything from `%IX0.x` → `%IX100.x+800-offset` (i.e. read the slave mirror in the ST source too) — depends on matiec accepting triple-digit `%IX` / `%IW` addresses. The fdamador image's matiec had already rejected multi-digit `%IW10` (`LR2_METER_HI`, dropped as a workaround — see the header comment in `fuel_farm.st`). Bulk-moving 21 variables without probing first risked breaking every input binding.

**Fix (overlay), landed in two commits.**

1. **Probe commit (`c31d31d`)** — added `PROBE_100_0 AT %IX100.0 : BOOL;` alongside the existing `%IX0.x` bindings and deployed. matiec compiled clean. Confirmed the fork accepts triple-digit `%IX` addresses (the earlier `%IW10` failure was almost certainly a different grammar quirk — possibly nested `(* ... *)` comments or mixed VAR blocks — not a "no multi-digit addresses" rule).

2. **Bulk-move commit (`ea91a34`)** — moved all 11 DIs from `%IX0.0-%IX1.2` to `%IX100.0-%IX101.2`, all 10 IRs from `%IW0-%IW9` to `%IW100-%IW109`, and dropped the probe. Modbus DI/IR *offsets* seen by the outside world are unchanged (FUXA/Telegraf still poll DI 800+/IR 100+), because slave-device polling puts the fuelsim mirror at `%IX100.0 == Modbus DI 800`, `%IW100 == Modbus IR 100` on the OpenPLC memory model. Header comment updated to document the new address map + why (post-2026-07-20 reshuffle so inputs read real slave-polled data instead of unbound zeros).

Interlock logic bodies didn't change — they reference variables by name, not address. Only the AT bindings moved.

**Prerequisite fix (same day, commit `6b2aea9`).** The bootstrap script's idempotency check only compared program *name* (`Program: fuel_farm`), not source contents — so edits to fuel_farm.st were silently ignored on redeploy (the runtime stayed on the previously-compiled binary). Added `--force-program` flag to `openplc_bootstrap.py` that bypasses the "already Running with our program" check and re-uploads/recompiles/restarts. The Ansible task wires this on conditionally: `argv: {{ _openplc_bootstrap_argv + (['--force-program'] if st_program.changed else []) }}` — so future .st edits actually propagate.

**Verify.** After bulk-move deploy: `verify_fuel_farm.sh` 52/52 green, FUXA Process Overview still shows all live values (T-101 90%, T-102 82%, T-103 78%, Header 20 psi, T-101 Temp 68°F, LR-1 R-03 loading T-103 preset 9107, LR-2 R-04 loading T-101 preset 5310), ESD banner still green. Nothing regressed on the outside; the invisible change is that the ST program now computes `LR1_PERMIT = GROUND_OK AND DEADMAN AND NOT OVERFILL AND NOT T101_LO_LVL AND NOT ESD_ACTIVE` on real data.

**Note on Ansible's task-status readout.** The bootstrap task's `changed_when: "'no change' not in bootstrap_result.stdout"` reports the task as `ok` (not `changed`) when the slave-device step prints `-- no change` even if the program step re-uploaded. The check trips on the substring anywhere in stdout. Cosmetic — the .st actually recompiled — but if a future maintainer relies on task status to gate a handler, the changed_when should be tightened to match the program-step's own output (e.g. `'re-uploading anyway' in stdout or 'not Running' in stdout`).

**Follow-up (not blocking).** Interlock EFFECT still isn't visually observable on the HMI: the ST only *forces* outputs FALSE on interlock fail, never *sets* them TRUE — so `LR1_LOAD_VLV` etc. always read as False whether the interlock passed or failed. To make the interlock outcome visible, either (a) add `LR1_LOAD_VLV := LR1_PERMIT;` before the `IF NOT LR1_PERMIT THEN` block, or (b) add computed-permit read-back outputs (`LR1_PERMIT_OUT AT %QX2.0 := LR1_PERMIT;`) that FUXA can bind to. Both are trivial ST edits; deferred pending an operator-UX decision on which failure modes deserve their own indicator.

## 2026-07-17 · gap · roles/fuel_hmi -- FUXA container comes up with no project loaded (screens are blank)

**Symptom.** After `fuel_hmi` deploys, the FUXA container is running and :1881 is reachable, but logging in to the web UI shows a blank editor — no devices, no views. The bind-mounted JSON at `/opt/fuxa/projects/fuel_farm.json` is present in the container's `_projects` volume but FUXA doesn't auto-load it.

**Why.** FUXA's `_projects/` bind mount is used by the editor's Save/Load buttons and by the demo-project asset, not by server startup. The active project lives in FUXA's SQLite DB inside `_appdata/` and can only be modified via web-UI editor actions or the `/api/project` REST endpoint. The role's original stopgap was a `debug` task telling the operator to author screens in the FUXA editor — same manual-step problem we hit with OpenPLC, and it broke idempotent redeploy.

Also — the original `fuxa_project.json.j2` had the wrong top-level schema. FUXA expects `{version, projectFile, server, devices, hmi, charts}` with views inside `hmi.views[]`; the old template put `views` at the top level. Modbus tag `memaddress` values were also wrong (strings like `"Coils"` instead of the numeric constants FUXA's Modbus driver expects: `0`, `100000`, `300000`, `400000`). Modbus tag `address` was zero-based; FUXA's driver subtracts 1 internally so it expected 1-based. `variableId` format was `"Device@Tag"` instead of `"Device^~^Tag"`.

**Fix (overlay).**

1. Rewrote `templates/fuxa_project.json.j2` with the schema verified against `frangoteam/FUXA` `client/dist/assets/project.demo.fuxap` + the Modbus driver source (`server/runtime/devices/modbus/index.js`). All four Modbus register classes now use numeric `memaddress`, 1-based `address`, correct `variableId` format, and `divisor = 1/scale` for read-side unit conversion. Deterministic device UUID pinned in `group_vars/fuel.yml` (`fuxa_plc_device_uuid`) so idempotent re-imports don't create duplicate devices.

2. Two SVG views authored in separate `files/svg_process_overview.svg` and `files/svg_rack_detail.svg` (Jinja inlines them into `svgcontent` via `lookup('file', ...) | tojson`). Views use `svg-ext-value` widgets bound to numeric tags (tank levels, flow, header press, meter, active-truck IDs), `svg-ext-shape` widgets with `clockwise` color actions bound to boolean tags (status indicators, ESD banner), and `svg-ext-button` widgets with `onSetView` events for cross-view navigation.

3. New `files/fuxa_bootstrap.py` runs on the target after container start. Idempotent-by-content: GETs `/api/project`, checks whether `PLC-FuelFarm` device + both view IDs (`v_process_overview`, `v_rack_detail`) are present, and only POSTs if not. Falls back to `/api/signin` auth if unauth GET returns 401.

**Verify coverage.** New check hits `/api/project` on `172.16.45.3:1881` and greps for `PLC-FuelFarm.*v_process_overview.*v_rack_detail` in the response — one round-trip proves device + both views are loaded.

**Follow-up.** The `/api/project` endpoint is inferred from prior FUXA versions and demo-project structure; if the fdamador...err, frangoteam/fuxa image variant we're on uses a different path (`/api/prjresource`, `/api/prj/...`), the bootstrap script's error output will surface it and we iterate. Same pattern that got us through OpenPLC.

**Amendment (2026-07-17, same day).** Project loaded cleanly on first import but FUXA logged `try to create PLC-FuelFarm but plugin is missing!` and never opened a Modbus TCP connection to ff-plc-1:502 (verified via `ss -tn` on both hosts — zero established connections to port 502 from control-room-hmi). Root cause: my template set `"type": "ModbusTCP"`, but FUXA's plugin registry (visible at `/api/plugins`) actually keys the Modbus driver as `"type": "Modbus"`. FUXA's device factory did a plugin lookup by type, found nothing matching `ModbusTCP`, warned once, and silently skipped the device — leaving the JSON structure loaded but the poller inert. TCP vs RTU is inferred from `property.address`+`port` being present (vs serial fields), not from the type string. One-character template change.

Bootstrap `project_matches` also strengthened to compare device *type* (not just name+view IDs), so re-imports after schema fixes don't get silently skipped by the idempotency check.

**Third amendment (2026-07-17, same day).** Type fixed, plugin found — but still no TCP connection to ff-plc-1:502. Deeper probe showed `ls .../node_modules/modbus-serial` = "No such file or directory". `frangoteam/fuxa:latest` ships with the plugin *metadata* baked in (`server/runtime/devices/modbus/index.js` exists) but does NOT install the actual `modbus-serial` npm dependency — presumably to keep image size down. When FUXA instantiates the device, `require('modbus-serial')` throws, the driver module fails to construct, and no connection is attempted. The initial "plugin is missing!" WARN only fires for *unknown types*, so with type fixed the failure mode goes silent. Role now runs `docker exec fuxa npm install modbus-serial --proxy http://10.255.240.1:3128 --https-proxy http://10.255.240.1:3128` inside the container (proxy flags needed because OT hosts only reach the npm registry via the mgmt-plane proxy) and restarts the container to pick up the new module. Idempotent by pre-check on the target dir. Persists across normal restarts (writable layer); re-runs on container recreation.

**Fourth amendment (2026-07-17, same day). REVERTED the `Modbus` change from amendment #2.** After the modbus-serial npm install landed, still no connection. Read the actual factory source at `server/runtime/devices/device.js:61`:

```javascript
} else if (data.type === DeviceEnum.ModbusRTU || data.type === DeviceEnum.ModbusTCP) {
    if (!MODBUSclient) { return null; }
    comm = MODBUSclient.create(data, logger, events, manager, runtime);
```

FUXA uses TWO different enums for `type`:
- `/api/plugins` reports the family: `"Modbus"`.
- `device.type` in project.json needs the transport-specific value: `"ModbusTCP"` or `"ModbusRTU"`.

My earlier amendment (2) had inferred both from `/api/plugins` and reduced everything to `"Modbus"` — which caused the factory's if-chain to fall through with no branch matching. Silent failure (return `false` at index.js:169 → "plugin is missing!" WARN). The *original* `"ModbusTCP"` from my very first draft was actually correct all along; the real bug was only the missing npm package. Reverted `type` to `"ModbusTCP"` and updated bootstrap `EXPECTED_DEVICE_TYPE` accordingly.

Root-cause tree, for future me:
- "plugin is missing!" at `devices/index.js:169` fires when `Device.create()` returns `null` or an object without `.start`.
- `Device.create()` returns `null` for TWO different reasons that look identical:
  1. Type not matching any if-branch (my amendment 2 hit this).
  2. Type matches but the sub-driver import (`require('./modbus')`) returned falsy at server load time — because a *transitive* dependency (`modbus-serial`) is not installed. (My original state hit this.)
- Distinguish by: query `/api/plugins`. If your `type` isn't listed there as an entry's `type`, you're in case (1) — fix the type. If it IS listed with `"current": ""`, you're in case (2) — install the npm dep for that plugin's `module`.

**Fifth amendment (2026-07-17, same day). FUXA driver bug: coil `memaddress` key-format mismatch between main tag loop and fragmented section.** With type corrected and modbus-serial installed, FUXA logged 10 `load error! TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Items')` — exactly one per coil tag. Read `server/runtime/devices/modbus/index.js` lines 218 and 785-806:

  - Main tag loop keys memory with `formatAddress(data.tags[id].memaddress, token)`. For `memaddress: 0` (my coils), this produces the string `"0-0"`.
  - The fragmented-section calls `getMemoryAddress(lastStart, true, token)`. For addresses `< 100000` (i.e. coils), that function hardcodes `formatAddress('000000', token)` = `"0-000000"`.

Same memory region, two different string keys — `memory["0-000000"]` is undefined, hence the `.Items` on undefined. Workaround in our template: emit `"memaddress": "000000"` (six-zero string) instead of `"memaddress": 0` for coils. `parseInt("000000")` still evaluates to 0 in the other places the driver reads memaddress numerically, and now both key computations produce the identical `"0-000000"`. DIs/IRs/HRs don't hit this because their constants (100000/300000/400000) are numeric on both code paths.

Bootstrap's idempotency check compares device name + type + view IDs — it doesn't see intra-tag schema changes. Added `--force` flag to bypass the check and always POST, wired into the role. Re-POSTing ~40 KB of JSON per deploy is trivial and guarantees intra-project schema drift always reaches FUXA. Better long-term option is a content hash but not worth building until we have a reason.

## 2026-07-17 · gap · roles/fuel_plc -- OpenPLC exposes an empty memory image because it never polls fuel-farm-sim (field bus §2 missing)

**Symptom.** After the fuel farm subsystem shows 49/49 verify green and FUXA is confirmed polling ff-plc-1 with 40 tags landing 329+ samples in the DAQ SQLite (`daq-data_c39d...db`), every single tag value reads **zero**. `T101_LEVEL=0`, `HEADER_PRESS=0`, `LR1_FLOW=0` — even after 90s+ of runtime while fuelsim's physics simulation is actively running with tanks starting at 78-90% full.

**Root cause.** The fuel_plc role uploaded and started an OpenPLC program on ff-plc-1 with proper %IX/%IW/%QX/%QW variable bindings — but the .st code has no polling logic and OpenPLC has no slave device configured to autonomously fetch data from fuel-farm-sim. So ff-plc-1's Modbus server on :502 was serving OpenPLC's internal memory image, which starts at zero and stayed zero because nothing writes to it. FUXA was reading a fully-functional, correctly-mapped, real Modbus port — just with all-zero values.

CLAUDE.md §7 describes the intended field-bus wiring: OpenPLC as Modbus master polling fuel-farm-sim ("field bus"), exposing a curated image on its own :502 ("SCADA bus"). Build sheet §2. The role only implemented the SCADA-bus side; field-bus polling was never configured.

**Fix (overlay).** Extended `openplc_bootstrap.py` with an optional slave-device configuration step. After the runtime is Running with our program, the script:

1. GETs `/modbus` and checks whether a slave device with the configured name already exists (idempotent).
2. If not, POSTs `/add-modbus-device` with fuel-farm-sim as a Generic Modbus TCP Device at 172.16.46.17:502, slave_id=1.
3. Mirrors 11 discrete inputs (di_size=11) + 10 input registers (ai_size=10) into OpenPLC's %IX0.0-%IX1.2 / %IW0-%IW9 — matches our .st's %IX / %IW declarations 1:1.
4. Explicitly sets `do_size=0`, `aor_size=0`, `aow_size=0` — OpenPLC never writes to fuelsim's coils or holding registers. Fuelsim's own state_machine drives those from the replay timeline and is authoritative; letting OpenPLC clobber them would break the physics loop.
5. Cycles the runtime (stop_plc → wait → start_plc → poll dashboard until Running) so the new slave device takes effect.

Form field → DB column mapping (learned from `/workdir/webserver/pages.py` and the `Slave_dev` schema): `device_ip` → `ip_address`, `device_port` → `ip_port`, `di_*` → `di_*`, `do_*` → `coil_*`, `ai_*` → `ir_*`, `aor_*` → `hr_read_*`, `aow_*` → `hr_write_*`. The form also requires serial fields (`device_cport`, `device_baud`, `device_parity`, `device_data`, `device_stop`) even for TCP devices — send `/dev/ttyS0`, `19200`, `None`, `8`, `1` as inert defaults.

**Follow-up.** If we ever want OpenPLC's interlock logic to *actually stop the pumps* by writing back to fuelsim (rather than just reading), we'd flip `do_size` to 10 and add ladder logic in the .st that only writes coils under specific conditions. That's a full closed-loop control simulation and out of scope for MVP.

## 2026-07-17 · deferred · roles/fuel_hmi -- FUXA widget rendering: SVG layout renders, live-value bindings do not

**Symptom.** Hand-authored FUXA project.json + SVG deploys cleanly, browser (from bs-eng05 → Firefox) shows the full Process Overview P&ID (three tank cylinders with fill bars, pump circles, loading rack panels, ESD banner, nav buttons). But every numeric readout stays at the placeholder `--` from the SVG. `svg-ext-shapes-text` items dict entries don't get their content updated from the bound tag values, even though the tag values ARE reaching FUXA (`daq-data_c39d....db` has live rows: T101_LEVEL=90, HEADER_PRESS=20, etc.).

**Root cause.** Reading `client/dist/main.*.js` (`getInTreeIdAndType`): FUXA auto-derives a widget type per SVG element from its tagname (`svg-ext-shapes-text`, `svg-ext-shapes-circle`, etc.) when there's no explicit `type=` attribute. But grepping the client bundle for actual recognized widget types shows only base `svg-ext-shapes` + specialized types like `svg-ext-value`, `svg-ext-gauge_progress`, `svg-ext-html_input`. `svg-ext-shapes-text` isn't a real widget handler — it's a placeholder that renders the raw SVG without variable binding.

The demo project's working value widgets (`VAL_...` IDs, `svg-ext-value` type) are compound `<g>` groups with a specific inner structure (background rect + inner text element + FUXA-editor-injected classes/attrs) that the client's `svg-ext-value` handler expects. A plain `<text>` element without that structure can't be adapted post-hoc via items-dict metadata alone.

**Deferred workarounds (not implementing now, listed for the record):**
1. Add `type="svg-ext-value"` attribute to each SVG element the items dict claims is a value widget. If FUXA's element-type-attribute path uses the same widget registry as its items-dict-type path, this might work with minimal effort. Not tested.
2. Hand-author the compound widget structure — refactor SVGs so each value widget is a `<g id="VAL_..."><rect .../><text .../></g>` group matching what the FUXA editor generates. Higher-effort, requires copying the demo project's inner class/attr conventions.
3. Use `svg-ext-html_input` in read-only mode instead of `svg-ext-value`. HTML input widgets have simpler DOM contracts and might bind more forgivingly.
4. Skip hand-authoring: use FUXA's own web editor to build the P&ID once, export the resulting `.fuxap`, commit as `files/fuel_farm.fuxap` and have the bootstrap POST that verbatim. Loses templatability from group_vars but sidesteps every schema quirk.

**Why deferred.** The SVG *layout* is validated and looks like a real OT operator screen. The complete OpenPLC → SCADA-bus → FUXA → DAQ data chain is proven with real values landing in Grafana-compatible storage (SQLite). §5 Grafana dashboards give the same "operator sees live values" milestone through a much better-documented and less-adversarial tool. FUXA widget rendering can come back later as polish.

**Update (2026-07-20).** Deep-dive session solved the value-widget path. Findings, in order:

  1. **Compound-widget structure** — `svg-ext-value` needs an outer `<g id="VAL_..." type="svg-ext-value">` with an inner `<text id="VAL_..._inner">` containing placeholder content. Auto-derived types like `svg-ext-shapes-text` from a plain `<text>` are not real widget handlers.
  2. **Server-side broadcast subscription** — `settings.broadcastAll:false` is the default; widgets only receive values for tags the client explicitly subscribed to. Our project doesn't trigger client-side subscription registration, so the server was pushing empty `values: []` arrays. Fix: POST `{broadcastAll:true}` to `/api/settings` on every deploy. Now wired into `fuxa_bootstrap.py:ensure_broadcast_all`.
  3. **Client-side value routing** — the client-side handler `this.socket.on(DEVICE_VALUES, ...)` uses `fi.values[i].id` DIRECTLY as the `this.variables[]` key. So `variableId` in widget items should be the plain tag name (e.g. `"T101_LEVEL"`), NOT the demo project's `"DeviceName^~^TagName"` format — the demo works because a `deviceAdapterService` translates plain-tag-name → adapter-scoped ID, but the adapter mechanism doesn't kick in for our project. Plain name works universally.
  4. **HR mirror lands in IR area, not HR area** — OpenPLC's slave-device polling with `aor_size=8` doesn't put values at Modbus HR 100+ as the display code implied. Empirical `pymodbus` sweep of ff-plc-1 showed fuelsim's HR 0 (5210) shows up at **Modbus IR 111** on ff-plc-1 — the mirror lives in the input-register memory area with a single-word padding gap after `ai_size`. So FUXA/Telegraf HR-mapped tags need `memaddress: 300000` (IR) and `address: h.addr + 111 + 1`.
  5. **Status-dot color actions — deferred.** `svg-ext-shapes-circle` items with `type: "color"` action and `options: {fillA, fillB, strokeA, strokeB, interval}` (per the `class le` schema found in the client bundle) crash FUXA's widget-init pipeline. Attempted `options: {fill:"#..."}` also silently didn't fire. The exact accepted structure requires an editor-generated live example to compare against; reverse-engineering the minified Angular bundle without one hit diminishing returns.

Final shipped state: numeric readouts render live (tank levels, temp, pressure, active-truck, source-tank, preset, flow across both views); status dots stay static grey; ESD banner stays static green. Grafana provides the color-coded state-change operator glance in the meantime.

## 2026-07-17 · bug · roles/fuel_historian/templates/telegraf.conf.j2 -- multiple `coils = [...]` blocks in Jinja loop = invalid TOML (only last one survives) + missing slave-mapped address offsets

**Symptom.** After the fuel_historian role runs, Grafana panels bound to InfluxDB tags stay empty. Telegraf appears to be running (`systemctl status telegraf` shows active) but InfluxDB's `fuel` bucket has few or wrong-address writes.

**Root causes (two, discovered together).**

1. Old template's `{% for c in fuel_modbus_coils %}coils = [...]` pattern emits one `coils = [{...}]` block PER TAG. TOML is happy to parse each, but each subsequent block *replaces* the prior on the same key. Net result: only the last tag's entry survives per category. Same bug for `discrete_inputs`, `input_registers`, `holding_registers`. Grafana panels bound to any but the last register in each category see no data.
2. The addresses were the "logical" ones from `group_vars/fuel.yml` (0-9 for coils, 0-10 for DIs, etc.) matching what our .st program declares locally. But now that OpenPLC is configured as a Modbus master polling fuel-farm-sim (post-2026-07-17 fuel_plc slave-device fix), the slave-polled data lands at Modbus DI 800+ / IR 100+ on ff-plc-1, not at DI 0+ / IR 0+. Telegraf reading DI 0+/IR 0+ gets zeros. This mirrors the FUXA fix from the same day (`d.addr + 800` / `r.addr + 100` shifts).

**Fix.** Rewrote the template to emit ONE array per register category with tags joined inline. Applied the +800 shift to DI addresses and +100 to IR addresses. Coils and Holding Registers stay at 0-based direct addresses because those are OpenPLC's own ST-program-set values (fuelsim's own coils/HRs aren't mirrored by design; the state_machine owns them). One-liner comment in the template explains the address-space translation for future maintainers.

## 2026-07-16 · gap · roles/fuel_plc/tasks/main.yml — OpenPLC container comes up with no program loaded (Modbus :502 dead)

**Symptom.** After `fuel_plc` deploys, verify shows `ff-plc-1 OpenPLC container running` green and `ff-plc-1 OpenPLC web :8080` green, but `Modbus :502` refuses TCP indefinitely. The container is happy, the web UI works, and `/opt/openplc/programs/fuel_farm.st` is present in the bind mount — but nothing binds :502 because the OpenPLC runtime hasn't been told what program to run.

**Why the manual step was there.** `fdamador/openplc` (v3 fork) needs a web-UI upload + `/start_plc` to activate a program — merely dropping the .st file into a bind mount doesn't register it in `openplc.db`. The role's original stopgap was a `debug` task printing "upload via web UI on first deploy", which broke the range's promise of full idempotent redeploys.

**Fix (overlay).** New Python helper `roles/fuel_plc/files/openplc_bootstrap.py` runs on the target after container start:

1. GET /dashboard → if runtime is Running with our program, exit 0 (idempotent).
2. Otherwise: `/stop_plc` → multipart POST `/upload-program` (.st file) → scrape `prog_file` hidden input from response → POST `/upload-program-action` (metadata) → GET `/compile-program?file=…` (drain the streaming matiec log) → GET `/start_plc` → poll `/dashboard` until Running (60s timeout).

Also adds `python3-requests` to the apt install for the target, and creates `/opt/openplc/bin/` for the script. The main.yml task's `changed_when` fires only when the bootstrap actually mutated state (script prints `no change` on idempotent runs).

**Verify coverage.** Old `ff-plc-1 Modbus :502 accepting TCP (needs program uploaded via web UI)` label reworded (no longer needs a hint), and a new stricter probe added: fuel-farm-sim's pymodbus reads HR 0 (`LR1_PRESET_GAL`) from ff-plc-1 → if that succeeds, the program is loaded, the addresses are mapped, and the SCADA-bus is truly usable.

**Follow-up (not blocking).** Container's `openplc.db` isn't persisted — the current bind mounts (`/workdir/etc`, `/workdir/programs`) don't cover the DB path (`/workdir/webserver/openplc.db`). Every container restart re-runs the bootstrap (idempotent, cheap), which is fine for CI/reset semantics but means the OpenPLC admin creds env is re-applied every restart. If persistence is added later, this role needs a real `/change_password` rotation call.

**Amendment (2026-07-17, same day).** First run of the bootstrap script from an actual deploy revealed that `fdamador/openplc` does NOT honor `OPENPLC_ADMIN_USER` / `OPENPLC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars — the container came up with the hardcoded `openplc/openplc` default and rejected the vault password. Bootstrap now tries the vault-configured creds first, falls back to `openplc/openplc` on failure, and stderr-WARNs when the default succeeded so the role can flag "rotation still owed". Real `/change_password` rotation is deferred because the endpoint URL varies across forks and would re-invalidate the session mid-flow.

**Second amendment (2026-07-17, same day).** Second attempt got past login+upload+metadata but /dashboard never reported "Running" within 60s. Direct HTML inspection showed two more mismatches with what I'd assumed about the fdamador variant:

  1. **`/compile-program` is asynchronous.** It returns an HTML shell almost immediately, and the actual matiec+gcc log is polled via a separate `/compilation-logs` endpoint (the web UI's own JS calls it every 1 s until it sees one of two sentinel strings). My original code was streaming the /compile-program response body — which is pure HTML/CSS — thinking it was the log, so it never detected compile errors and always thought compile succeeded. When /start_plc fired, the runtime binary hadn't actually been produced (leaving a `[compile_program] <defunct>` zombie in the container), so runtime silently stayed Stopped. Bootstrap now GETs /compile-program to kick off the background compile, then polls /compilation-logs until it sees either `Compilation finished successfully!` (proceed to /start_plc) or `Compilation finished with errors!` (fail with last 2.5 KB of log).
  2. **Dashboard-state regexes were guessing at markup.** The real fdamador HTML uses `<b>Status: <font color = 'Red'>Stopped</font></b>` and `<b>Program:</b> fuel_farm</p>` — neither of which contained the "runtime status running" text my old regex looked for. So the idempotency check "already Running with our program? then no-op" was structurally broken: it always returned (stopped, None) regardless of actual state. Regexes rewritten to anchor on the actual `<font>...</font>` state word and the `<b>Program:</b>` label. Also handles a new "compiling" state (rare, but observable during racing polls).

## 2026-07-16 · bug · roles/fuel_sim/templates/fuelsim.service.j2 — service can't bind Modbus :502 as unprivileged user

**Symptom.** After fuelsim.service is enabled and running, `verify_fuel_farm.sh` shows fuel-farm-sim :502 `MODBUS_REFUSED` and `ss -tlnp | grep :502` returns nothing. `journalctl -u fuelsim` reveals:

```
pymodbus.logging Failed to start server [Errno 13] error while attempting to bind on address ('172.16.46.17', 502): permission denied
```

The pymodbus server-run loop catches the OSError, logs the warning, and *continues* — so the process stays "active (running)" without ever listening. Modbus is silently down.

**Root cause.** The unit runs as `User=fuelsim` (an unprivileged system account, by design — the daemon shouldn't need root). Port 502 is <1024 → privileged on Linux → requires `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` at bind time. The systemd unit granted no capabilities to the exec, so the bind failed.

**Fix (overlay).** Add to the `[Service]` block:

```
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

Preferred over lowering `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` (system-wide, affects all users) or running the daemon as root. `AmbientCapabilities` requires systemd ≥ 229 (jammy ships 249, noble 255) — always available on our baseline. Also preferred over `setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+ep` on the venv python binary, which would leak the capability to *every* python invocation on the host (venv builds, ad-hoc `python3 -m` runs, etc.).

**Secondary observation for the upstream `pymodbus` project.** A bind failure inside `StartAsyncTcpServer` shouldn't downgrade to `WARNING` and let the coroutine return "Server listening." — this masks a fatal misconfiguration behind a healthy-looking service. Worth an upstream issue if we hit it again.

## 2026-07-16 · bug · roles/fuel_db/tasks/main.yml — fuel_rw got table INSERT but no sequence USAGE, breaking every INSERT with a SERIAL PK

**Symptom.** fuelsim's `state_machine.db_flusher` logs one traceback per event batch:

```
psycopg2.errors.InsufficientPrivilege: permission denied for sequence truck_queue_queue_id_seq
psycopg2.errors.InsufficientPrivilege: permission denied for sequence events_event_id_seq
```

Every INSERT into a table with a SERIAL/bigserial PK fails because Postgres invokes `nextval('<table>_<col>_seq')` under the caller's role, and treats sequence privileges independently from table privileges. Table INSERT alone is not enough.

**Root cause.** The role had one `postgresql_privs` task granting `SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE` to `fuel_rw` on `type: table`, but never granted anything on `type: sequence`. All the affected tables in `schema.sql.j2` (`events`, `truck_queue`, `load_txn`, `delivery_txn`, `tank_level_snap`) use SERIAL / bigserial PKs → each has an auto-created sequence → each INSERT hits the missing privilege.

**Fix (overlay).** Add a second `postgresql_privs` task with `type: sequence`, `objs: ALL_IN_SCHEMA`:
- `fuel_rw` → `USAGE,SELECT,UPDATE` (nextval + currval + `setval` — the last is defensively included so tools like `pg_dump --data-only` restore reads correctly).
- `fuel_ro` → `SELECT` (currval only, doesn't advance the sequence — safe for read-only dashboards).

**Why the acceptance schema tests missed it.** The verify script checks table *existence* (`\dt` in psql), not INSERT permission under the app role — so the tables all showed up green even though the app couldn't write to them. Post-fix, the verify script should be extended with a fuel_rw round-trip probe (INSERT ... RETURNING pk into a temp row, then DELETE) to catch this class of regression.

## 2026-07-14 · enhancement · site.yml — bootstrap fops.blackstone.mil\simspace from bs-dc01 before create_users

**Symptom.** On a fresh range deploy where fops-dc01 has just been promoted, `create_users` on the `pdc` group tries to open a WinRM connection to fops-dc01 as unqualified `simspace` — and gets `ntlm: the specified credentials were rejected by the server`. `simspace` doesn't exist yet as a `fops.blackstone.mil` domain user (create_users hasn't run there yet), and post-promotion the machine no longer falls back to local-SAM auth for that name. Workaround previously required a temporary `blackstone.mil\Administrator` override in `host_vars/fops-dc01.yml` for the immediate re-run, then removal afterward.

**Why bs-dc01 doesn't hit this.** Empirically, bs-dc01 keeps accepting unqualified `simspace` post-Install-ADDSForest — its local-SAM `simspace` account survives promotion and NTLM falls back to it. Install-ADDSDomain on the child (fops-dc01) leaves the machine in a state where the same fallback doesn't happen; the exact mechanism (SAM cleanup? primary-domain resolution order? Windows Server 2022 hardening for child DCs?) hasn't been isolated, but the behavioral difference is reproducible on every fresh deploy.

**Fix (overlay).** New play in `site.yml` inserted between `Post-dcpromo diagnostic snapshot` and `Create Users`:

- Runs on `pdc_blackstone` (bs-dc01), which accepts unqualified `simspace` fine.
- Uses PowerShell `Get-ADUser -Server fops.blackstone.mil -Credential blackstone.mil\Administrator` and `New-ADUser`/`Add-ADGroupMember` with the same explicit credential to reach fops-dc01 via AD RPC/LDAP (bypasses fops-dc01's broken WinRM).
- Creates `simspace` in fops.blackstone.mil with `PasswordNeverExpires` + adds to Domain Admins.
- Idempotent: if the user exists (re-runs, or partial prior deploy), it's a no-op for the create + a harmless re-add for the group membership.

After this play, `create_users` on fops-dc01 authenticates via unqualified `simspace` normally — because `fops.blackstone.mil\simspace` now exists as a DA. No more host_vars override dance on future fresh deploys.

## 2026-07-14 · bug · roles/pfsense_firewall/tasks/main.yml — remote-syslog daemon never reloaded when config already matched

**Symptom.** `verify_deployment.sh` failed on `soc-syslog receiving from bs-edge-fw` and `soc-syslog receiving from bs-ops-fw` (`STALE_OR_MISSING`). Both pfSense boxes had the correct block in `/cf/conf/config.xml`:
```
<syslog>
  <remoteserver>172.31.7.13</remoteserver>
  <enable></enable>
  <logall></logall>
  <ipproto>ipv4</ipproto>
</syslog>
```
but tcpdump on soc-syslog showed zero packets from either pfSense's interface IPs. On inspection: bs-edge-fw's `/etc/syslog.conf` had **no remote-forward stanza** (config.xml never got regenerated into the runtime file); bs-ops-fw's `syslogd` process **wasn't running at all**.

**Root cause.** The task `Configure remote syslog forwarding` only called `system_syslogd_start()` when it had staged a config diff (`$changed = true`). On a re-deploy where config.xml already had the right values but runtime state had drifted (either the file regen missed or the daemon crashed and never got restarted), no reload was triggered.

**Fix (overlay).** Split into two tasks: the write-config task stays conditional (idempotent), and a new **always-runs** follow-up unconditionally calls `system_syslogd_start(true)` — the `true` flag forces config regeneration + daemon restart even when PHP thinks nothing changed. Belt-and-suspenders fallback: if `pgrep syslogd` still returns nothing after that, run `service syslogd onerestart`. This guarantees runtime = config.xml on every deploy.

## 2026-07-14 · bug · roles/create_users/tasks/main.yml — Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy targets caller's domain, not local DC

**Symptom.** On fops-dc01 (child DC), `create_users` failed at:
```
Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy : Unable to contact the server. This may be because this server does not exist, it is currently down, or it does not have the Active Directory Web Services running.
CategoryInfo: (BLACKSTONE:ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy) [ADServerDownException]
```
Note the target realm in the error: `BLACKSTONE` — the parent forest — not `fops.blackstone.mil` where the task was running.

**Root cause.** `Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy` (and `Set-`) default to the **current user's** domain, not the local machine's. When Ansible authenticates to fops-dc01 with a parent-forest EA credential (e.g. via the temporary `blackstone.mil\Administrator` host_vars override needed post-promotion), both cmdlets try to reach the parent forest DC across the network via ADWS — which intermittently fails even when bs-dc01's ADWS is healthy. Knock-on effect: `simspace` was never created as a domain user in fops.blackstone.mil, which cascaded into `additional_dc` on fops-dc02 failing with `"You have not supplied user credentials that belong to Domain Admins/Enterprise Admins"` (the credential it was passing, `simspace@fops.blackstone.mil`, didn't exist).

**Fix (overlay).** Pin both cmdlets to `-Server $env:COMPUTERNAME`:
```powershell
(Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy -Server $env:COMPUTERNAME).ComplexityEnabled
```
```powershell
$dom = Get-ADDomain -Server $env:COMPUTERNAME
Set-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy -Identity $dom.DistinguishedName -Server $env:COMPUTERNAME -ComplexityEnabled $false
```
Now the query always talks to the local DC regardless of caller identity.

## 2026-07-14 · bug · roles/dcpromo_child_heal — WinRM/NTLM credential format + reboot mechanics (three sub-fixes)

**Symptom.** The heal role from 2026-07-13 was structurally sound but its first `win_ping` never succeeded, so `end_host` fired and no healing occurred. Symptoms across three iterations:

1. First iteration used `.\simspace` for local auth — got `ntlm: credentials rejected` on every attempt.
2. Second iteration switched to `MACHINE\simspace` — got a Jinja `recursive loop detected in template string` from `heal_local_password: "{{ ansible_password | default(...) }}"` (since the task also sets `ansible_password: "{{ heal_local_password }}"`).
3. Third iteration used `Start-Job { Restart-Computer }` to fire the healing reboot async — but the job died with the WinRM PowerShell process, so the reboot never happened; registry values were cleared but not applied.

**Root causes.**

1. `.\user` is a Windows console shorthand, **not an NTLM auth format**. pywinrm doesn't accept it. Real NTLM requires `MACHINENAME\user` or `user@REALM`.
2. Ansible template resolution: setting a role default to `{{ ansible_password | default(...) }}` and then having a task set `ansible_password: {{ default_var }}` creates a resolution cycle → recursion depth error.
3. `Start-Job` runs the scriptblock as a child process of the current PowerShell session. When WinRM closes the session, PowerShell dies, and any Start-Job children die with it before `Start-Sleep` finishes.

**Fixes.**

1. Use `{{ inventory_hostname | upper }}\simspace` for MACHINE\user format; fall back to `MACHINE\Administrator` (dcpromo's "local admin fix" task sets its password to `domain_admin_password`).
2. Hard-code the literal password in role defaults; never reference `ansible_password` from a default consumed by a task that then rewrites `ansible_password`.
3. Replace `Start-Job` reboot with `shutdown.exe /r /t 5 /f` — launches a detached system process that survives WinRM session termination.

Also added: try DEFAULT (unqualified `simspace`) creds **first**. On a CLEAN baseline snapshot the machine is in WORKGROUP mode → default creds work → `meta: end_host` with no healing needed. Only fall through to MACHINE\ variants if the default is rejected (true half-joined state).

## 2026-07-13 · enhancement · roles/dcpromo_child_heal — auto-heal half-join residue before init

**Symptom.** Third consecutive fresh-range deploy hit the same failure pattern: `Install-ADDSDomain` on fops-dc01 succeeds far enough to (a) register the `FOPS` cross-reference in bs-dc01's Configuration NC and (b) set fops-dc01's Primary DNS Suffix + Domain hint to `fops.blackstone.mil` — then dies before AD services come up. Every subsequent deploy times out at `init` for 30 min × 3 attempts (NTLM rejects unqualified `simspace` because the machine's now-broken domain hint prefixes it as `fops.blackstone.mil\simspace`). Manual recovery loop (metadata cleanup via Administrator/EA + SimSpace snapshot revert) has taken 4 rounds so far.

**Root cause.** Install-ADDSDomain is not transactional on this platform — partial failures leave residue on both the parent forest (CrossRef under CN=Partitions, orphan Server + NTDS Settings under CN=Sites) and the local machine (Domain / NV Domain registry hints under Tcpip\\Parameters). Retrying Install-ADDSDomain against this state fails at pre-flight because the CrossRef already exists. And init can't even reach the host to trigger the retry.

**Fix (overlay).** New role `roles/dcpromo_child_heal` runs at the very top of site.yml (before `init`), targets `pdc_fops`, uses local `.\simspace` credentials (unaffected by the broken domain hint). Idempotent flow:

1. Ping via `.\simspace`. If unreachable, `meta: end_host` (SimSpace-platform issue, not ours to solve).
2. Detect state: `HALF_JOINED` (PartOfDomain=True + child domain + ADWS/NTDS Stopped), `ALREADY_DC` (running), or `CLEAN`. Only `HALF_JOINED` triggers healing.
3. Delegate CrossRef + orphan-DC-object removal to `pdc_blackstone` using Administrator (auto-EA post-forest-root promotion) — exactly the manual `Remove-ADObject` sequence we've been running by hand.
4. Clear `Tcpip\\Parameters!Domain`, `Tcpip\\Parameters!NV Domain`, and `NTDS\\Parameters!DcPromoInProgress` on the half-joined host.
5. Reboot (`win_reboot`, 900 s timeout).
6. Verify default (unqualified `simspace`) credentials work post-reboot; if yes, healed → init proceeds normally.

Combined with the 2026-07-10 DNS-bootstrap fix, this makes the child-domain path resilient to Install-ADDSDomain partial failures: any prior failure is auto-cleaned at the start of the next deploy rather than requiring manual metadata-cleanup + snapshot-revert cycles.

**Why the pre-init position matters.** init's `wait_for_connection` uses default (unqualified) credentials with a 30-min timeout and `any_errors_fatal: true`. If the healing play ran later, it could never fire because init would abort the whole deploy first. Placing it upstream, with `any_errors_fatal: false`, lets the heal proceed and end_host cleanly whether or not residue is present.

## 2026-07-10 · bug · roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml — child-domain DNS bootstrap picks wrong interface (or none)

**Symptom.** On child-domain promotion, Install-ADDSDomain fails with:
```
PROMOTION_EXCEPTION: Verification of user credential permissions failed.
An Active Directory domain controller for the domain "blackstone.mil"
could not be contacted. Ensure that you supplied the correct DNS domain name.
```
Preceding task ("Point primary DNS at parent PDC before Install-ADDSDomain") logs `NO_IFACE_FOUND` on tag-limited retries (`--tags dcpromo_child` skips `common`, so no NIC yet has DNS populated) or, on full deploys, silently picks the mgmt NIC (Ethernet0 gets DNS `172.31.2.7` written to it — but mgmt has no default route, so DNS lookups for `_ldap._tcp.blackstone.mil` still fail).

**Root cause.** The task selected `Get-DnsClientServerAddress ... | Where { ServerAddresses.Count -gt 0 } | Select -First 1`. Two failure modes:
1. Tag-limited retry / snapshot-reverted baseline → no interface has DNS → filter returns nothing → `NO_IFACE_FOUND` → downstream Install-ADDSDomain gets a misleading "could not be contacted" error.
2. Full deploy where `common` set DNS on both NICs → the mgmt NIC (Ethernet0, lower InterfaceIndex) wins → DNS gets written to an interface with no default route → SRV resolution still fails.

**Fix (overlay).** Rewrote the interface-picker with a three-tier strategy: (1) prefer the interface carrying the IPv4 default route (== prod NIC per airfield contract — mgmt NIC has empty gateway), (2) fall back to "first with DNS set" (post-`common` steady state), (3) last-resort to any non-loopback/non-tunnel IPv4 interface. Also added `failed_when: "'NO_IFACE_FOUND' in ..."` so a genuine no-interface state fails loudly at the DNS-bootstrap task instead of masking behind Install-ADDSDomain's downstream error. Rationale for using default route as primary signal: it's the invariant enforced by the airfield host_vars contract (§8 of CLAUDE.md) — mgmt NICs always have `gateway: ""`, so the default route is always on the prod NIC.

## 2026-07-08 · bug · roles/global_dns/templates/simspace_includes.conf.j2 — corpora `redirect` zone collision aborts unbound

**Symptom.** On a fresh range, corp hosts can't resolve any external name — bs-dc01's forwarders point at 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4/1.1.1.1 (is-inet lo aliases) but every query times out. Digging into is-inet: unbound isn't running at all. Attempting to start it manually reveals the reason:
```
error: local-data in redirect zone must reside at top of zone,
       not at www.github.com. A 70.39.65.196
fatal error: Could not set up local zones
```

**Root cause.** is-inet's `/etc/unbound/corpus.d/*.conf` files ship hundreds of `local-zone: "<domain>." redirect` entries (Ukraine/Russia/US censorship-simulation corpora). Our `global_dns_records` in `group_vars/all.yml` add sub-domain `local-data` entries for some of the same domains (github.com, google.com, microsoft.com, etc. — plus airfield's aviation zones and blackstone.mil). Unbound refuses to accept sub-domain records in a `redirect` zone — the whole config load fails and the daemon exits.

**Fix (overlay).** Extended `roles/global_dns/templates/simspace_includes.conf.j2` to emit `local-zone: "<zone>." transparent` at the top of the file for every unique zone that appears in `global_dns_records`. `transparent` overrides the corpora's `redirect` type so our sub-domain records get honored. Trade-off: the corpora's redirect no longer applies to our overridden zones — fine for scenario purposes since our records are what we want anyway.

**Fix (upstream).** Same patch in `range-development-ansible/roles/global_dns/templates/simspace_includes.conf.j2`. Any range that adds records under a corpora-covered domain hits this bug.

## 2026-07-08 · bug · is-inet image — unbound doesn't auto-start; log file + PID file missing

**Symptom.** After range provisioning, corp DNS queries to 8.8.8.8 (is-inet lo alias) time out. Inside the is-inet container, `ss -lnu | grep :53` returns nothing — **unbound isn't running**. Postfix / Dovecot / httpd (for webmail) are all up. Manually running `docker exec -d is-inet /usr/sbin/unbound` fails with `Could not open logfile /var/log/unbound.log: Permission denied`.

**Root cause.** The RC-IS-INET container image's entrypoint launches the mail stack but not unbound. `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` specifies `logfile: "/var/log/unbound.log"`, but that file doesn't exist inside the container and the `unbound` user can't create it. There's also a stale `/var/run/unbound.pid` on some baselines.

**Fix (overlay).** New `roles/is_inet_fix/` on airfield-range. Deploys three things on the is-inet host:
1. A shell script at `/usr/local/sbin/airfield-unbound-supervise.sh` that checks whether unbound is listening in the container; if not, creates the logfile with `unbound:unbound` ownership, clears any stale PID, and runs `docker exec -d is-inet /usr/sbin/unbound`.
2. A systemd oneshot service that runs the script at boot.
3. A systemd timer that re-runs the script every minute so any container restart re-launches unbound.

Idempotent + self-healing across container/host restarts.

**Fix (upstream / platform).** Either bake `/var/log/unbound.log` (owned by `unbound`) into the container image, or extend the image entrypoint to launch unbound alongside the mail stack. Also worth: the `range-development-ansible/roles/handlers/handlers/main.yml`'s `reload unbound` handler uses `ignore_errors: yes`, which masks this failure silently — either drop the ignore or explicitly probe for a running daemon first.

## 2026-07-08 · platform · RC-IS-INET image — eth1 provisioned as /32 with no default gateway

**Symptom.** is-inet's `eth1` (data-plane interface, at 200.200.200.2) comes up with a `/32` mask and no default gateway. `ip route` shows only the host's own /32; is-inet has no connected route to its own 200.200.200.0/24 LAN. Result: replies to any external client get `ENETUNREACH` and are silently dropped.

**Root cause.** RC-IS-INET image bug — same one PowerPlant documented on 2026-05-22. PowerPlant's UPSTREAM_FIXES noted a "planned" `is_inet_fix` role that was never built. Airfield hit the same wall today.

**Fix (overlay).** `roles/is_inet_fix/` drops a netplan supplement at `/etc/netplan/99-airfield-eth1.yaml` with the correct `/24` addressing + default gateway (`200.200.200.1` = bs-edge-rtr eth0). `netplan apply` on change. Persistent across reboots. Values driven from `host_vars/is-inet.yml` variables (`isinet_dataplane_ip`, `_prefix`, `_gateway`) so airfield's exact addressing isn't baked into the role.

**Fix (upstream / SimSpace).** Image cloud-init/netplan should honor the YAML-declared prefix and configure a default gateway pointing at the subnet's GATEWAY-roled neighbor. Same PowerPlant entry from 2026-05-22 applies here — the airfield `is_inet_fix` role should be back-ported to `range-development-ansible/roles/is_inet_fix/` (or PowerPlant/ss-pp-ab).

## 2026-07-08 · gap · corp -> is-inet: bs-edge-rtr missing return route to corp

**Symptom.** After is-inet is functional, corp DNS queries reach unbound and unbound replies — but corp hosts still don't get answers. tcpdump on is-inet's eth1 shows queries from `172.31.x.x` arriving and replies going back the way they came. But the replies never reach corp.

**Root cause.** `bs-edge-rtr`'s routing table has only its default route (via `200.200.200.2` = is-inet) plus its two connected /30 (`199.252.163.0/30` toward bs-edge-fw) and /24 (`200.200.200.0/24` toward is-inet). **No route to `172.31.0.0/16`**. eBGP with bs-edge-fw is up but shows `(Policy) (Policy)` for prefix counts — corp routes aren't being advertised due to some route-map/filter on bs-edge-fw's `pfsense_bgp` side. is-inet's reply → bs-edge-rtr → follows default back to is-inet → routing loop → TTL exhaust → drop.

**Fix (overlay).** Added an `extra_static_routes` entry to `host_vars/bs-edge-rtr.yml`:
```yaml
extra_static_routes:
  - route: "172.31.0.0/16"
    next_hop: "199.252.163.1"        # bs-edge-fw WAN
```
Consumed by the customer `vyos` role's "Additional VyOS static routes" overlay play. Combines with bs-edge-fw's outbound NAT (see next entry) so return traffic finds its way home even without eBGP advertising corp routes.

**Fix (upstream).** Either (a) fix the BGP route-map filtering on bs-edge-fw so corp routes actually get sent to bs-edge-rtr, or (b) leave this as a static-route belt-and-suspenders permanently. Static is arguably cleaner at this WAN edge — it works even if BGP goes sideways, and matches CLAUDE.md §3 (item 8) intent.

## 2026-07-08 · gap · host_vars/bs-edge-fw.yml — outbound NAT must be `automatic`, not `disabled`

**Symptom.** Even after is-inet is fixed and bs-edge-rtr has a return route, DNS from a random corp host is fragile — depends on bs-edge-rtr's route being present.

**Root cause.** The `pfsense_firewall` role defaults to `pfsense_disable_outbound_nat: true` (correct for INTERNAL transit firewalls like bs-ops-fw). But `bs-edge-fw` is the RANGE-EDGE firewall: corp <-> simulated internet. `172.31.0.0/16` is RFC1918 and not publicly routable, so NAT at the edge is realistic and expected. Without it, is-inet sees corp source IPs and depends entirely on bs-edge-rtr knowing where to route them back.

**Fix (overlay).** Set `pfsense_disable_outbound_nat: false` in `host_vars/bs-edge-fw.yml`. The role's "disable" code becomes a no-op; a fresh pfSense install then keeps its stock `automatic` outbound-NAT mode.

**Fix (upstream).** Consider making the `pfsense_firewall` role's disable-NAT default OFF, or driven by an explicit `pfsense_nat_outbound_mode` variable (accepting `automatic` / `hybrid` / `disabled`). The current all-or-nothing behavior forces every range to think about it per-firewall.

## 2026-07-08 · platform · fresh child DC — GPMC New-GPLink fails with HRESULT 0x8007054B despite AD services healthy

**Symptom.** On a freshly-promoted child DC (fops-dc01 in fops.blackstone.mil), `New-GPLink -Target "DC=fops,DC=blackstone,DC=mil"` returns:
```
The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted.
(Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007054B)
```
Reproducible even as `fops.blackstone.mil\Administrator`. Also `Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership` returns "The server is not operational" while `Get-ADDomain` and `Get-GPO` succeed — mixed AD subsystem readiness.

**Detection.** All of these work:
- `Get-Service NTDS, ADWS, DNS` all `Running`
- `Resolve-DnsName fops.blackstone.mil` returns child DC's A records
- `Resolve-DnsName _ldap._tcp.pdc._msdcs.fops.blackstone.mil` returns fops-dc01
- `Get-ADDomain` returns `DC=fops,DC=blackstone,DC=mil`
- `Get-GPO -Name "Mapped Network Drives"` returns the GPO created earlier in the same role

Yet the specific RPC/GPMI subsystem used by `New-GPLink` (and by ActiveDirectory's `Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership`) cannot bind to the domain. Points to RPC endpoint mapper or DRSUAPI binding not fully established on the freshly-promoted DC — the same subsystem that hosts DsReplicaGetInfo used by GPMC.

**Fix (overlay).** Wrapped the `Mapped Drive — fops.blackstone.mil` play tasks in a `block`/`rescue` structure so a first-deploy failure doesn't halt the rest of the playbook. (Initial attempt used `include_role` with `ignore_errors: true`, but that flag only affects the include-operation itself, NOT the tasks pulled in by the included role — the failing DSC task inside the role still marked the host as failed and aborted the play. `block`/`rescue` is the only reliable way to make in-role tasks non-fatal.) Mapped drives are convenience UX, not core range functionality. Re-run `--tags mapped_drive_fops` after the deploy completes; the RPC/GPMI subsystem usually settles within 10-30 minutes of promotion.

**Fix (upstream / platform).** No clean upstream fix. Possible mitigations:
- Add a `Wait-ForRpcSubsystem`-style task after dcpromo(child) that pings the RPC endpoint until it responds, before running any GPMC operation.
- Move `mapped_drive` for child domains to run AFTER a `Reboot Windows` cycle post-dcpromo (rebooting the DC forces full re-init of the RPC subsystem).
- Retry `New-GPLink` internally in the role with a delay loop rather than failing on first attempt.

## 2026-07-08 · gap · roles/mapped_drive/tasks/main.yml — DN builder broke for child domains

**Symptom.** Deploy failed on fops-dc01 with:
```
TASK [mapped_drive : Link GPO to OU]
FAILED! => 'domain_tld_name' is undefined
```

**Root cause.** The GPLink task built the domain DN as `DC={{ short_domain_name }},DC={{ domain_tld_name }}`, assuming a two-label FQDN (label + TLD). Works for `blackstone.mil` (=> `DC=blackstone,DC=mil`) but not for `fops.blackstone.mil` (three labels; there's no clean single-label `domain_tld_name` value to use). `group_vars/fops.yml` correctly defines only `domain_name` and `short_domain_name` and omits `domain_tld_name`.

**Fix (overlay).** Rebuilt the DN dynamically from `domain_name` by splitting on dots and joining with `,DC=`:
`Path: "DC={{ domain_name.split('.') | join(',DC=') }}"`. Works for arbitrary FQDN depth. No group_vars changes needed.

**Fix (upstream).** In `range-development-ansible/roles/mapped_drive/tasks/main.yml`, replace the two-part construction with the dynamic split form so the role is child-domain safe out of the box. Same pattern applies to any other DN-building tasks in customer roles (grep for `short_domain_name` + `domain_tld_name` co-usage).

## 2026-07-08 · gap · roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml — use parent Administrator for Install-ADDSDomain instead of granting EA to simspace

**Symptom.** On a fresh range's first deploy, dcpromo(child) partially completed Install-ADDSDomain on fops-dc01 — set the machine's Primary DNS Suffix to `fops.blackstone.mil` (systeminfo showed `Domain: fops.blackstone.mil`, `OS Configuration: Member Server`) — then failed. Fops-dc01 was left in a "half-joined" state: registry indicates domain membership, but only local SAM accounts exist (`net users` shows only Administrator/simspace/etc.) and `net group /DOMAIN` returns "domain not contacted". Consequence: unqualified NTLM auth to fops-dc01 fails for `simspace` (server misinterprets it as `fops.blackstone.mil\simspace` which doesn't exist). Only `.\simspace` (explicit local SAM) authenticates. All subsequent playbook plays that target fops-dc01 fail unreachable → 30-minute init hangs on retries.

**Root cause.** The prior (2026-07-07) EA-grant task on this line depended on `simspace` existing as an AD user in the parent forest before dcpromo(child) ran. But in `site.yml`, `Create Users` (line 470) runs AFTER dcpromo(child) (line 461) — so at the moment EA-grant fires, `simspace` may not yet exist in blackstone.mil. Even if `microsoft.ad.domain` migrates the local `simspace` user during forest creation, it's a Domain User (not EA and not DA), and `Install-ADDSDomain -DomainType ChildDomain` requires BOTH memberships — creating a new domain modifies the forest's Partitions container AND alters the schema replication topology. So EA alone was insufficient; the promotion still failed authorization.

**Fix (overlay, landed 2026-07-08).** Deleted the EA-grant task entirely. Changed the Install-ADDSDomain credential from `{{ parent_domain_name }}\{{ domain_admin }}` (= blackstone.mil\simspace) to `{{ parent_domain_name }}\Administrator`. The parent forest's built-in Administrator is auto-EA + auto-DA + Schema Admin as soon as microsoft.ad.domain finishes on bs-dc01; no group-membership manipulation needed. Password is preserved from the local Administrator, which the "local admin guest customization fix" tasks earlier in the dcpromo role already reset to `{{ domain_admin_password }}` (= Simspace1!Simspace1!). Idempotent, no delegate_to, no dependency on create_users having run first.

**Fix (upstream).** In `range-development-ansible/roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml`, when adding child-domain support (currently the customer role only handles forest-root creation), use the parent forest's Administrator credential rather than the operator's Ansible user. Alternatively, if using a domain user like `simspace` is preferred, split `create_users` into per-domain runs and enforce ordering: forest-root users must exist BEFORE any child-domain promotion attempts.

## 2026-07-07 · gap · roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml — child-domain path needs Enterprise Admin on the parent forest (SUPERSEDED)

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-08:** The EA-grant overlay described below was **deleted from the role**. Replaced by the newer 2026-07-08 fix that uses the parent-forest built-in `Administrator` credential (auto-EA + auto-DA + Schema Admin) for `Install-ADDSDomain`, so no group-membership manipulation is needed at all. See the 2026-07-08 `dcpromo` entry above. Entry retained here for historical context and for the root-cause explanation (why simspace-as-DA is not enough for child-domain creation), which the newer entry references.

**Symptom.** After the DNS bootstrap fix (below) landed, `Install-ADDSDomain` still failed on fops-dc01. With the surface-errors fix in place (commit 0857a62), the actual message came through:
```
PROMOTION_EXCEPTION: Verification of user credential permissions failed.
You have not supplied user credentials that belong to the Enterprise Admins
group. The installation may fail with an access denied error.
```
`C:\Windows\debug\dcpromoui.log` on fops-dc01 confirmed: `User is not EA`.

**Root cause.** Creating a child domain modifies the Partitions container in the forest's Configuration NC, which only Enterprise Admins can write to. The role uses `simspace` as the promotion credential — `simspace` is a Domain Admin in blackstone.mil (per the `create_users` role) but NOT an Enterprise Admin. Only the built-in `Administrator` gets auto-EA on forest-root install; any subsequently-created domain user needs explicit membership.

**Fix (overlay — REVERTED 2026-07-08).** Originally: added a task in the child-domain path that granted EA to `{{ domain_admin }}` on the parent forest before Install-ADDSDomain, delegated to bs-dc01. That approach was found to be insufficient (EA alone; `Install-ADDSDomain -DomainType ChildDomain` also requires Domain Admin membership) AND fragile (depends on simspace existing as an AD user before create_users runs, which the site.yml ordering did not guarantee). Deleted on 2026-07-08 in favor of using `blackstone.mil\Administrator` directly.

**Fix (upstream).** See the 2026-07-08 entry.

## 2026-07-07 · gap · roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml — child-domain path needs DNS pointed at parent PDC pre-promotion

**Symptom.** After the AD-Domain-Services install fix landed on 2026-07-06, fresh-range deploys got past the ADDSDeployment error but `Install-ADDSDomain` still didn't complete — fops-dc01 remained a WORKGROUP standalone. Later, all 15 fops member hosts failed to join with:
```
Computer 'fops-flight01' failed to join domain 'fops.blackstone.mil' from its
current workgroup 'WORKGROUP' with following error message: The specified
domain either does not exist or could not be contacted.
```
Diagnostic on fops-dc01: DomainRole=2 (standalone), ADDS installed, ADDSDeployment module importable, primary DNS = `172.31.3.12,172.31.3.11` (itself + sibling), `Resolve-DnsName blackstone.mil` empty. TCP 389 to bs-dc01 succeeded — network path fine, DNS bootstrap broken.

**Root cause.** `Install-ADDSDomain -DomainType ChildDomain -ParentDomainName blackstone.mil` needs to resolve `_ldap._tcp.blackstone.mil` SRV records to find a parent-forest DC to authenticate against. The default SimSpace image sets fops-dc01's primary DNS to the two designated fops.blackstone.mil DCs (172.31.3.11 = itself, 172.31.3.12 = fops-dc02). Neither can answer for blackstone.mil until child promotion completes — chicken-and-egg. Install-ADDSDomain fails silently (or bails so quickly the overall task appears to succeed), fops-dc01 stays standalone, and every downstream fops member join fails.

**Fix (overlay, landed 2026-07-07).** Added a pre-promotion task in the child-domain path of `roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml` that sets fops-dc01's primary DNS to `{{ parent_domain_pdc_ip }}` (172.31.2.7 = bs-dc01) plus 8.8.8.8 fallback, then calls `Clear-DnsClientCache`. Runs after the AD-Domain-Services install + reboot, before the Install-ADDSDomain block, gated by the same `when: parent_domain_name is defined` + `NEEDS_PROMOTION` guards. Introduces new `parent_domain_pdc_ip` variable in `group_vars/fops.yml`. After Install-ADDSDomain finishes and the reboot handler fires, fops-dc01 is itself a DC and its own DNS starts answering; downstream member joins can point at fops-dc01 (172.31.3.11) as designed.

**Fix (upstream).** In `range-development-ansible/roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml`, if a `parent_domain_name` var is present, the role should automatically set primary DNS to a parent DC before running Install-ADDSDomain — nobody who runs a child-domain promotion should have to figure this out themselves. The customer's dcpromo role currently only supports single-domain forest creation; a proper child-domain mode with DNS bootstrap would eliminate this whole class of failure.

## 2026-07-06 · gap · site.yml + roles/domain_member_retry — `pause` incompatible with `strategy: free`

**Symptom.** Both Join Domain plays (blackstone + fops) had `strategy: free` for wall-clock parallelism. Deploy fails immediately after the first member's Check-if-already-joined task:
```
TASK [domain_member_retry : Check if already domain joined]
changed: [bs-supply03]
ERROR! The 'pause' module bypasses the host loop, which is currently not
supported in the free strategy and would instead execute for every host
in the inventory list.
```
All 3 deploy.sh attempts fail identically before any host actually joins.

**Root cause.** `roles/domain_member_retry/tasks/main.yml:22` uses `ansible.builtin.pause` to wait for the post-join NIC flap to settle. Ansible's `free` strategy explicitly rejects `pause` because pause is a per-play blocker, not per-host — under free, it would either block all hosts (defeating the point) or fire N times per host (nonsense). Ansible chose to hard-fail the play rather than pick either behavior. Identical failure hit PowerPlant on 2026-07-03; airfield inherited the same optimization + the same bug when the strategy: free pattern was copied across.

**Fix (overlay).** Reverted `strategy: free` on the two Join Domain plays in `site.yml`. The other 6 `strategy: free` plays keep the speedup — strip_apipa, root_certs, network_discovery, AUE bundle, AE bundle, splunk-forwarder, sysmon — none of them use `pause`.

**Fix (upstream).** In `range-development-ansible/roles/domain_member_retry/tasks/main.yml`, replace `pause: seconds: N` with a delegated `wait_for` on the local Ansible controller:
```yaml
- name: Wait for network reconfiguration to complete
  ansible.builtin.wait_for:
    timeout: 30
  delegate_to: localhost
  become: false
```
`wait_for` works under `strategy: free`. This would let Join Domain — the single slowest play in the deploy — parallelize like the other 6 do.

## 2026-07-06 · gap · roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml — child-domain path missing AD-Domain-Services feature install

**Symptom.** On a fresh-range deploy the `dcpromo` role's child-domain task fails on `fops-dc01`:
```
TASK [dcpromo : Create child domain (this host becomes first DC of fops.blackstone.mil)]
fatal: [fops-dc01]: FAILED! => ...
  "message": "The specified module 'ADDSDeployment' was not loaded because no valid module
              file was found in any module directory."
  "target_name": "ADDSDeployment"
Import-Module ADDSDeployment -ErrorAction Stop
```
All 3 deploy.sh attempts fail identically at this task. Forest root (`bs-dc01`) succeeds because that path uses `microsoft.ad.domain`, which internally installs the feature; the child path uses `ansible.windows.win_powershell` directly.

**Root cause.** `Install-ADDSDomain` lives in the `ADDSDeployment` PowerShell module, which ships only once the **`AD-Domain-Services`** Windows Feature is installed on the host. The role installs `rsat-ADDS` (the RSAT client tools bundle — usable for querying an existing DC) but NOT the actual `AD-Domain-Services` role. `microsoft.ad.domain` auto-installs `AD-Domain-Services` as part of its own execution; the child-domain `win_powershell` block does not, so it hits `Import-Module ADDSDeployment` on a host that has only the RSAT client tools.

**Fix (overlay, landed 2026-07-06).** Added an `ansible.windows.win_feature` task for `AD-Domain-Services` with `include_management_tools: true` inside the child-domain gate (`when: parent_domain_name is defined`), followed by a conditional `win_reboot` in case the feature install requires it. Placed just after the "Compute child-domain label" set_fact and before "Check if host is already a DC". Idempotent: on subsequent runs, `win_feature` is a no-op if `AD-Domain-Services` is already present.

**Fix (upstream).** In `range-development-ansible/roles/dcpromo/tasks/main.yml`, make the RSAT install block install BOTH `AD-Domain-Services` (the role/feature) AND `rsat-ADDS` (the tools) unconditionally, before either mode runs. Both paths need the feature, and `microsoft.ad.domain`'s auto-install of it is an undocumented side effect that shouldn't be relied on.

## 2026-06-25 · platform · RC-VyOS-Router image — self-loop default routes per /24 interface IP

**Symptom.** A VyOS router with multiple /24 LAN interfaces (e.g. `bs-core-rtr` with Services/HQ/IT/Supply) loses its default route entirely after deploy. `show ip route` has no `S>* 0.0.0.0/0` line even though `static_route` declares one in host_vars; downstream subnets report "destination net unreachable."

**Detection.**
```
vyos@bs-core-rtr$ show configuration commands | grep 'static route 0.0.0.0/0'
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 172.31.1.5
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 172.31.2.1    # own eth1 IP

vyos@bs-core-rtr$ show ip route 0.0.0.0/0
% Network not in table
```

**Root cause.** The `RC-VyOS-Router:1.1.0` image template ships a `0.0.0.0/0` static for every /24 interface IP on the box, with the next-hop set to the router's own connected IP. FRR refuses to install a default whose next-hop resolves to a local interface and ECMPs the entire route out of the FIB — net result, no default route at all. Same root cause and same template behaviour PowerPlant documented on 2026-05-27 for the SimSpace VyOS image.

**Fix (upstream).** Strip the per-/24 `0.0.0.0/0 next-hop <self>` defaults from the `RC-VyOS-Router:1.1.0` image template before publish. The image should ship with NO baked-in default route — host_vars / playbook decides.

**Workaround (overlay).** Each affected VyOS host declares `extra_static_routes_remove: [{network, next_hop}]` listing every self-loop next-hop in host_vars. The "Remove stale VyOS static routes (image-baked self-loop defaults)" play in `site.yml` issues a matching `delete protocols static route ...` so only the real default (`static_route` set by the customer `vyos` role) survives. Currently applied to: `bs-edge-rtr`, `bs-core-rtr`, `bs-ops-rtr`, `bs-sec-rtr`, `bs-modbus-gateway`.

## 2026-06-25 · bug · roles/pfsense_firewall/handlers/main.yml (ported from PowerPlant)

**Symptom.** On any pfSense host that defines BOTH `pfsense_bgp` and `pfsense_ospf` in `host_vars` (the eBGP-edge case — `bs-edge-fw` here, `pp-external-firewall` in PowerPlant), the `restart frr` handler fails with `bgpd: -A option specified more than once! Invalid options.` after committing FRR config changes. `ospfd` never starts; the firewall loses its OSPF adjacencies and BGP session.

**Root cause.** The handler's shell heredoc has the two protocol-launch lines inlined:

```
{% if pfsense_bgp is defined %}/usr/local/sbin/bgpd -d -A 127.0.0.1 -f /var/etc/frr/frr.conf{% endif %}
{% if pfsense_ospf is defined %}/usr/local/sbin/ospfd -d -A 127.0.0.1 -f /var/etc/frr/frr.conf{% endif %}
```

Ansible's default Jinja config sets `trim_blocks=True` + `lstrip_blocks=True`. With both, the newline after the first `{% endif %}` is trimmed AND the leading whitespace of the next `{% if %}` is stripped — leaving `bgpd ... frr.conf/usr/local/sbin/ospfd ...` as one shell command. The shell parses `-A 127.0.0.1` twice (once from each command) and `bgpd` rejects it.

**Detection.** `restart frr` handler errors with the `-A option specified more than once!` message + bgpd usage dump. The smushed command is visible in the failure output as a single `cmd:` line.

**Fix (upstream).** Put each `bgpd`/`ospfd` launch on its own line with the `{% if %}` and `{% endif %}` on their own lines too, so Jinja's whitespace stripping leaves the launch lines intact:

```
{% if pfsense_bgp is defined %}
/usr/local/sbin/bgpd -d -A 127.0.0.1 -f /var/etc/frr/frr.conf
{% endif %}
{% if pfsense_ospf is defined %}
/usr/local/sbin/ospfd -d -A 127.0.0.1 -f /var/etc/frr/frr.conf
{% endif %}
```

**Workaround (overlay).** Already applied in `airfield-range/roles/pfsense_firewall/handlers/main.yml`. Back-port the same fix into `PowerPlant/ss-pp-ab/roles/pfsense_firewall/handlers/main.yml` — `pp-external-firewall` defines both `pfsense_bgp` (eBGP to ISP) and `pfsense_ospf` (area 0 on DMZ + EDGE_TRANSIT), so the same bug should affect PowerPlant FRR convergence (consistent with the "FRR convergence pending verification" note in ss-pp-ab/CLAUDE.md).

## 2026-06-25 · bug · range-development-ansible/roles/common/tasks/windows.yml

**Symptom.** Every Windows host DDNS-registers BOTH its mgmt adapter (Ethernet0, `10.255.240.0/20`) AND its data-plane adapter into AD DNS. `ping bs-dc01` round-robins onto the mgmt IP roughly half the time — which corp workstations can reach over the platform orchestration VLAN but which is supposed to be out of play in-scenario.

**Root cause.** The customer `common/tasks/windows.yml` "Disable control net DNS registration" task is a double-bug:
1. The loop value is misspelled `Ehternet0` — never matches the actual mgmt adapter.
2. The cmdlet parameter is misspelled `RegisterThisConnectionAddress` instead of the real `RegisterThisConnectionsAddress`.

Net result: the task fires but achieves nothing.

**Fix (upstream).** Correct both typos in `range-development-ansible/roles/common/tasks/windows.yml`:
- `Ehternet0` → `Ethernet0`
- `RegisterThisConnectionAddress` → `RegisterThisConnectionsAddress`

Same root cause and same fix PowerPlant documented on 2026-05-27.

**Workaround (overlay).** Two plays in `site.yml`:
1. `Strip mgmt interface from AD DNS registration` (hosts: windows) — explicitly disables DDNS on `Ethernet0` and re-registers so only the data-plane adapter's record stays.
2. `Purge mgmt-subnet A records from AD DNS` (hosts: pdc) — scrubs any `10.255.240.0/20` A records that already snuck into each forest's zone before play #1 lands.

## 2026-06-25 · gap · range-development-ansible/roles/dns

**Symptom.** `nslookup vcab.lan` works from a domain-joined workstation, but `nslookup hbo.com` (or any external name) times out — no traffic exits the forest.

**Root cause.** The customer `dns` role creates AD zones + the records listed in `internal_dns_records` but doesn't configure DNS server forwarders. The Windows DNS server returns SERVFAIL for any zone it isn't authoritative for.

**Fix (upstream).** Have the role optionally set `Set-DnsServerForwarder` based on a `dns_forwarders` group_vars list, or document the requirement in the role README.

**Workaround (overlay).** `Configure DNS forwarders to is-inet` play in `site.yml` runs against `[domain_controllers]` and sets the forwarder list to `8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 / 1.1.1.1` (is-inet's unbound aliases). Same pattern PowerPlant logged on 2026-05-22.

## 2026-06-25 · bug · range-development-ansible/roles/dns/tasks/main.yml

**Symptom.** First `dns` play run after a fresh `dcpromo` fails on both PDCs with `Failed to set properties on the zone <domain>: Failed to reset the directory partition for zone <domain> on server <DC>.`

**Root cause.** `dcpromo` auto-creates the forward zone for the new domain (e.g., `vcab.lan`) and stores it in the **domain** directory partition (`CN=MicrosoftDNS,DC=DomainDnsZones,...`). The customer `dns` role then runs `community.windows.win_dns_zone` with `state: present` + `replication: forest` (hardcoded). Because the zone already exists, the module attempts to **migrate** its replication scope from the domain partition to the forest partition. On a brand-new single-domain forest the migration call (`Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -ReplicationScope Forest`) errors with the "reset the directory partition" message; for our two-forest build it fails identically on `vcab.lan` (bs-dc01) and `flightops.lan` (fops-dc01).

**Fix (upstream).** Replace the hardcoded `replication: forest` in both zone tasks with a variable that defaults to a value compatible with the most common deployment shape (single-domain forest):

```yaml
replication: "{{ dns_zone_replication | default('domain') }}"
```

For ranges with multi-domain forests where forest-wide replication actually matters, set `dns_zone_replication: forest` in `group_vars/all.yml`. The literal comment `# or 'domain' or 'none' based on your needs` already in the role file suggests the original author intended this to be tunable; it just never was.

**Workaround (overlay).** Already applied in `airfield-range/roles/dns/tasks/main.yml` (both Forward and Reverse zone tasks). Functionally identical for vcab.lan and flightops.lan since each is a single-domain forest. Back-port the same change into `range-development-ansible/roles/dns/tasks/main.yml`.

## 2026-06-26 · bug · range-development-ansible/roles/create_users/tasks/main.yml

**Symptom.** `Install-ADDSDomainController` on `bs-dc02` / `fops-dc02` fails with:

```
Verification of user credential permissions failed. You have not supplied
user credentials that belong to the Domain Admins group or the Enterprise
Admins group.
```

…even after `create_users` ran cleanly with no errors. Verifying directly on bs-dc01:

```
Get-ADGroupMember "Domain Admins"   # only Administrator; no simspace
Get-ADUser simspace -Properties MemberOf
# MemberOf: { CN=Users,CN=Builtin,DC=vcab,DC=lan,
#             CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=vcab,DC=lan }
```

…so `simspace` exists with the right password, but it's in **`Builtin\Administrators`** (local domain group on each DC) instead of the global **`Domain Admins`** group required by Install-ADDSDomainController.

**Root cause.** The `Group Assignment` task in `create_users` uses:

```yaml
microsoft.ad.user:
  name: "{{ item.name }}"
  groups:
    set: "{{ item.groups }}"   # e.g., ["Domain Admins"]
```

When `microsoft.ad.user` resolves the group name `"Domain Admins"`, it walks AD in a search order that hits the **`CN=Builtin`** container first. There happens to be an `Administrators` group there (`Builtin\Administrators`), and the partial/loose match logic appears to match `"Domain Admins"` against it instead of the global `CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users` group. Net result: the user lands in `Builtin\Administrators`, which gives them local-admin rights on the DC machine but does NOT grant the domain-wide Domain Admins privilege.

**Fix (upstream).** Replace the loose `microsoft.ad.user` `groups: set:` block with an explicit `microsoft.ad.group` `members: add:` pass that resolves the group by sAMAccountName:

```yaml
- name: Force-add Domain Users to their declared groups (explicit sAMAccountName)
  microsoft.ad.group:
    identity: "{{ item.1 }}"        # group sAMAccountName from DomainUsers[*].groups
    members:
      add: ["{{ item.0.name }}"]
  loop: "{{ DomainUsers | subelements('groups') }}"
  loop_control:
    label: "{{ item.0.name }} → {{ item.1 }}"
```

`microsoft.ad.group identity:` resolves unambiguously — `"Domain Admins"` lands in the correct global group every time.

**Workaround (overlay).** Already applied in `airfield-range/roles/create_users/tasks/main.yml`: the original `Group Assignment` task is kept (it's idempotent and harmless), with the new `microsoft.ad.group` task appended as a belt-and-suspenders pass. Removed the stale `group_assignment` role reference from `site.yml`'s Create Users play — the customer role at `range-development-ansible/roles/group_assignment/main.yml` is malformed (file at role root instead of `tasks/main.yml`, wrapped as a full playbook) and silently contributes zero tasks; it's redundant with `create_users` doing the job inline anyway.

## 2026-06-26 · bug (stale) · range-development-ansible/roles/group_assignment

**Symptom.** The customer's `group_assignment` "role" looks like:

```yaml
- name: Create Users
  hosts: pdc
  roles:
    - create_users
    - group_assignment
```

The intent is to add each `DomainUsers` entry to the AD groups declared in its `groups:` list (most importantly `Domain Admins`). In practice the role does nothing, so the `simspace` user gets created but is never added to Domain Admins. The first downstream symptom is `additional_dc` failing on bs-dc02 / fops-dc02 with:

```
Verification of user credential permissions failed. You have not supplied
user credentials that belong to the Domain Admins group or the Enterprise
Admins group.
```

**Root cause.** The `group_assignment` "role" is malformed:

```
roles/group_assignment/
├── README.md
└── main.yml      ← wrong path (should be tasks/main.yml)
```

…and `main.yml` is wrapped as a full playbook (`hosts: pdc`, `gather_facts: false`, `tasks:`) instead of being a bare task list. When referenced under a play's `roles:` block, Ansible's role loader looks for `tasks/main.yml`, doesn't find it, and silently contributes zero tasks. The role appears to run cleanly in the playbook output, but no group assignments actually happen.

**Fix (upstream).** Reorganize the customer's role to the conventional layout:

```
roles/group_assignment/
├── README.md
└── tasks/
    └── main.yml   ← bare task body, no playbook wrapper
```

Bare task body:

```yaml
- name: Group Assignment
  community.windows.win_domain_user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    groups: "{{ item.groups }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ DomainUsers }}"
  when:
    - DomainUsers is defined
    - item.groups is defined
```

**Workaround (overlay).** Already applied in `airfield-range/roles/group_assignment/` — the tasks/main.yml exists with the bare task body and the old `main.yml` is deleted. Same fix should be back-ported to `range-development-ansible/roles/group_assignment/` (PowerPlant likely hits the same silent no-op, which would explain "FRR convergence pending verification" but not the broader AD trust posture — worth double-checking pp-dc02's Domain Admin membership).

## 2026-06-26 · bug · range-development-ansible/roles/mapped_drive

**Symptom.** Running `mapped_drive` against any non-DC Windows host fails with:

```
"msg": "Resource 'GroupPolicy' not found."
"msg": "Failed to invoke DSC Test method: The term 'Get-GPO' is not recognized..."
```

…on every member workstation / file server in both forests.

**Root cause.** The role uses `ansible.windows.win_dsc` with the **`GroupPolicy`** DSC resource (and `GPRegistryValue`, `GPLink` for the linked GPO). Both the DSC resource and the underlying `Get-GPO`/`Set-GPRegistryValue` cmdlets ship with `RSAT-GPMC`, which is **only installed by default on Domain Controllers**. Member workstations and member servers don't have it.

**Architecturally**, the role's intent IS to run once on a DC: create a single GPO, populate its registry values, link it to the domain root. GP replication then propagates the GPO to every DC and every member machine applies it at next login. Targeting member hosts directly was always the wrong shape — every member runs into the missing-module error and there's no benefit to running it per-host.

**Fix (upstream).** Either move the `mapped_drive` README to clearly call out "this role MUST run on a Domain Controller" or add a guard at the top of `tasks/main.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Fail early if RSAT-GPMC is missing
  ansible.windows.win_powershell:
    script: |
      if (-not (Get-Command Get-GPO -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
        throw "mapped_drive must run on a Domain Controller (RSAT-GPMC required)."
      }
```

**Workaround (overlay).** Already applied in airfield-range `site.yml`: both `Mapped Drive — vcab.lan` and `Mapped Drive — flightops.lan` plays now target `pdc_vcab` / `pdc_flightops` instead of `members_*`. The GPO replicates to every member automatically.

## 2026-06-26 · bug (recurring) · pfSense interface IP drops during FRR restart

**Symptom.** Hosts behind `bs-ops-fw` (Engineering `172.31.8.0/24`, SOC `172.31.7.0/24`) intermittently can't reach `bs-dc01` to join `vcab.lan`. Traceroute from a failed host (e.g., `bs-eng01 172.31.8.11`):

```
tracert -d 172.31.2.7
  1   172.31.8.1   <- bs-ops-fw responds
  2   172.31.8.1  reports: Destination host unreachable
```

OSPF adjacency is `Full` on bs-ops-fw (FRR shows it), and `bs-ops-rtr` knows the route to `172.31.2.0/24`. But `netstat -rn` on bs-ops-fw is missing the connected entry for `172.31.1.12/30` (SWITCH_3/vmx1) — vmx1 has no kernel IP, so the kernel rejects FRR's attempt to install the OSPF-learned route via that interface.

**Root cause.** The `pfsense_firewall` role's `restart frr` handler kills + restarts `zebra` and `ospfd`. On the SimSpace `RC_pfSense:1.0.0` image, that SIGTERM occasionally races with one of the data-plane interfaces and the kernel IP drops between the SIGTERM and the new daemon's `interface_attach`. After the handler completes, vmx1 (or whichever NIC lost the race) is up at L2 (FRR still gets Hellos) but has no IPv4 address at the kernel level.

The existing "Post-flight — re-verify data-plane interface IPs are bound" task in the role runs *before* the handler — so it can't catch a drop that happens *because of* the handler firing later in the same play.

**Fix (upstream).** Add a complementary post-handler rebind task that runs *after* `meta: flush_handlers`. Same PHP body as the pre-handler task (`interface_configure()` + raw `ifconfig`), just scheduled after the restart-frr handler fires.

**Workaround (overlay).** Applied in `airfield-range/roles/pfsense_firewall/tasks/main.yml` — new task "Post-handler — re-verify data-plane interface IPs survived FRR restart" runs immediately after the `flush_handlers` meta task. Does not re-notify `restart frr` (the daemons are already running; re-binding the kernel IP is enough — FRR's interface listener picks it up).

---

## 2026-06-29 · platform (recurring) · pfSense data-plane interface drops AFTER role finishes

**Symptom.** Every full `./deploy.sh` run, Eng + SOC member hosts (10 total, behind `bs-ops-fw`) fail `domain_member_retry` with "The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted." On `bs-ops-fw`, vmx1 (SWITCH_3) has lost its 172.31.1.14/30 kernel IP again — no connected route, OSPF route to vcab `172.31.2.0/24` can't install, hosts behind the firewall can't reach `bs-dc01`.

**Detection sequence:** `ifconfig vmx1` shows no `inet` line; `netstat -rn -f inet | head` is missing the `172.31.1.12/30 link#... vmx1` connected entry; `vtysh -c "show ip ospf neighbor"` shows the adjacency `Full` (LSAs flow at L2); `vtysh -c "show ip route 172.31.2.0/24"` shows the route in FRR but `netstat` doesn't have it in the kernel.

**Root cause (best understanding so far).** pfSense's `write_config()` triggers a background interface refresh on the SimSpace `RC_pfSense:1.0.0` image. The pre-handler `Post-flight — re-verify data-plane interface IPs are bound` task in `roles/pfsense_firewall/tasks/main.yml` and the post-handler companion `Post-handler — re-verify ...` both catch drift that happens DURING the play, but they can't catch a refresh that fires seconds-to-minutes AFTER the play completes — by then Ansible has moved on to the AD foundation plays and the vmx1 binding silently disappears in the gap.

**Fix (upstream).** Would require either a SimSpace image change to stop the delayed interface refresh, or a pfSense FRR package change to bind the data-plane IPs at a lower level (e.g., via `rc.conf.local` ifconfig lines) so they survive write_config refreshes.

**Workaround (overlay).** Four layers of defense in `airfield-range`:

1. `pfsense_firewall` role's `Post-flight — re-verify data-plane interface IPs are bound` task (pre-handler).
2. `pfsense_firewall` role's `Post-handler — re-verify data-plane interface IPs survived FRR restart` task (right after `meta: flush_handlers`).
3. Standalone play in `site.yml` named `pfSense — pre-AD interface re-verify (catches delayed vmx drop)` that fires between `pfSense firewalls` and `dcpromo`. 20-second settle pause + PHP rebind. Tagged across every AD-foundation tag (`strip_apipa`, `domain_member_retry`, `dcpromo`, etc.) so scoped runs can't accidentally skip it.
4. **Final layer (2026-06-29, after layers 1-3 still failed):** background watchdog daemon installed by the `pfsense_firewall` role at `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/airfield_iface_watchdog`. Loops every 30 seconds running the same rebind PHP, logging each rebind to syslog with tag `airfield-iface-watchdog`. Layers 1-3 are time-bounded (they only run during a deploy window); layer 4 is the only one that survives between deploys, which is when we observed the actual vmx1 drops happen (2-5 minute gaps from a known-good rebind to the next break, well after Ansible moved on).

When any rebind fires, watch `/var/log/messages` on the pfSense for an `airfield-iface-watchdog` syslog entry. Status: `service airfield_iface_watchdog status`. The maximum window where vmx1 stays broken is now ~30 seconds (one watchdog cycle).

## 2026-06-29 · bug · roles/pfsense_firewall/files/airfield_iface_watchdog.sh — skipped vmx1 on bs-ops-fw

**Symptom.** Even after the watchdog daemon (layer 4 above) was installed and verified running, every full deploy still produced "domain not contacted" failures on the 10 Eng/SOC hosts behind `bs-ops-fw`. vmx1 (172.31.1.14, SWITCH_3 transit toward bs-ops-rtr) stayed dropped indefinitely — the watchdog never logged a rebind for it.

**Root cause.** The watchdog script started with `if ($key === "lan" || $key === "wan") continue;` — intended to skip the management interface and the (non-existent on a transit firewall) WAN interface. But pfSense's `config.xml` assigns the key `wan` to whichever interface holds the **default gateway**. On `bs-ops-fw`, vmx1 is the default-gateway-facing interface (`GW_OPS_RTR` toward bs-ops-rtr), so pfSense keys it `wan`. The watchdog therefore deliberately skipped the very interface that keeps dropping.

**Fix (overlay).** Changed the skip condition from `$key === "lan" || $key === "wan"` to `$phys === "vmx0"`. Per CLAUDE.md §3 row 10, vmx0 is the management NIC on every pfSense firewall in this build, so excluding by physical name (rather than by config-key) reliably skips only the mgmt plane while supervising all data-plane interfaces — including the default-gateway-facing one. The lan-vs-wan keying inside pfSense is irrelevant to whether an interface is data-plane.

## 2026-06-30 · bug (upstream pfSense/FreeBSD) · pfSense syslog forwarding omits HOSTNAME field

**Symptom.** After enabling remote syslog forwarding (`syslog/enable` + `syslog/remoteserver` + `syslog/logall` in pfSense `config.xml`, then `system_syslogd_start()`), packets arrive at the SOC collector but `$hostname` is unparseable, so rsyslog's per-host template writes them to `/var/log/remote/<source-ip>/syslog.log` (e.g. `/var/log/remote/172.31.1.21/` for bs-ops-fw) instead of `/var/log/remote/bs-ops-fw/`.

**Detection.**
```
tcpdump -i any -n -A "udp port 514 and src <pfsense-ip>" -c 5
# Packets look like:
<30>Jun 30 16:24:03 dhclient[21361]: No DHCPOFFERS received.
#       ^^^^^^^^^^^^ timestamp     ^^^^^^^^^^ program — HOSTNAME field is missing
```

VyOS routers on the same collector format correctly (`Jun 30 16:24:03 bs-core-rtr systemd[1]: Started ...`).

**Root cause.** pfSense's FreeBSD syslogd does not insert the local hostname when forwarding messages received via the chrooted log socket (`/var/dhcpd/var/run/log`), and on pfSense 2.8.1 this behavior extends to most non-dhclient sources too. The remote messages are technically malformed RFC3164. Confirmed on pfSense 2.8.1 (SimSpace image `RC_pfSense:1.0.0`); was reportedly working on earlier PowerPlant images where the rsyslog template comment notes "pfSense sends its hostname unqualified (pp-ot-firewall)".

**Fix (upstream).** Would require a pfSense / FreeBSD syslogd patch to consistently insert the local hostname on remote forwards, regardless of which log socket the message came in on.

**Workaround (overlay).** Map source-IP → hostname on the rsyslog side. `roles/syslog_server/templates/30-remote.conf.j2` now iterates `syslog_source_ip_map` (a list of `{ip, name}` dicts from host_vars/soc-syslog.yml) and emits one `if $fromhost-ip == '<ip>' then set $!hostfile = '<name>';` line per entry. Non-pfSense sources still flow through the default `$hostname`-from-message path. The map is small (2 entries today, one per pfSense firewall) and inventory-driven, so adding a third firewall is one host_vars line.

After the fix, restart rsyslog on soc-syslog (the role's handler does this on template change) and any new packets land in `/var/log/remote/<hostname>/`. Stale IP-named directories from before the fix can be deleted manually.

## 2026-06-30 · platform · pfSense data-plane dhclient poisons zebra route installation

**Symptom.** On a fresh range deploy, ALL Eng + SOC member hosts (10 total, behind bs-ops-fw) fail `domain_member_retry` with "The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted." Every other Windows host joins fine — only the subnets that have to traverse bs-ops-fw fail. The watchdog reports vmx1 bound, OSPF neighbors Full, FRR's `show ip route` shows `O>* 172.31.2.0/24 via 172.31.1.13` (selected + installed in FIB). But `netstat -rn -f inet` is missing `172.31.2.0/24`, missing the default route, and missing everything else FRR claims to have installed via vmx1. `route -n get 172.31.2.7` returns "route has not been found." Routes via vmx3 (sec-rtr direction) install correctly; routes via vmx1 (ops-rtr direction) do not.

**Detection.**
```
# On bs-ops-fw:
vtysh -c "show ip route" | head -40
# Output includes mysterious bogus connected entries:
C>* 10.41.240.0/20  is directly connected, vmx1, 02:19:24

# Plus the legit:
C>* 172.31.1.12/30  is directly connected, vmx1
# These bogus C>* entries are NOT visible in `ifconfig vmx1` (which shows
# only the configured 172.31.1.14) -- they are stale state baked into
# zebra's connected-route view at zebra startup time.

ps auxww | grep "dhclient.*vmx"
# Reveals: dhclient running on vmx1 (data-plane) alongside vmx0 (mgmt).
_dhcp    6037   0.0  0.2  14408  3228  -  SCs  20:09  dhclient: vmx1
```

**Root cause.** SimSpace's `RC_pfSense:1.0.0` image spawns `dhclient` on EVERY `vmxN` interface at boot, regardless of whether config.xml has the interface set to `ipv4_type=static`. dhclient transiently acquires leases from the SimSpace backend platform networks (10.41.240.0/20, 192.168.1.0/24 observed). pfSense's `interface_configure()` then sets the interface to the configured static IP and removes the alias, but zebra has ALREADY read the connected-route table during its startup and recorded the transient subnets as `C>*`. Zebra then silently refuses to install any OSPF route via that interface because it can't unambiguously select among the (apparent) multiple connected paths.

**Fix (upstream).** SimSpace's pfSense 1.0.0 image should set the data-plane interfaces to `ipv4_type=staticv4` at the rc.conf level so dhclient never spawns on them, OR pfSense's `interface_configure()` should explicitly `pkill -f "dhclient.*<phys>"` when switching an interface from DHCP→static.

**Workaround (overlay).** Two defenses in `roles/pfsense_firewall`:

1. **Deploy-time kill** — `tasks/main.yml` "Kill dhclient on data-plane interfaces" task runs AFTER `interface_configure()` and BEFORE the `meta: flush_handlers` that triggers `restart frr`. Net effect: when zebra starts (or restarts), dhclient is dead on every vmx1+, so zebra's connected-route view is clean and OSPF route installation works.

2. **Runtime kill** — the `airfield_iface_watchdog.sh` daemon now runs `pkill -f "dhclient.*vmx[1-9]"` at the start of each 30-second loop iteration. If pfSense (or some image-side script) respawns dhclient between deploys, the watchdog kills it within 30s. Logged to syslog with tag `airfield-iface-watchdog` when a kill occurs.

Manual recovery if a deploy precedes the fix landing on the live firewall: `pkill -f "dhclient.*vmx[1-9]"; pkill -9 zebra; pkill -9 ospfd; sleep 3; /usr/local/sbin/zebra -d -A 127.0.0.1 -s 90000000 -f /var/etc/frr/frr.conf; sleep 4; /usr/local/sbin/ospfd -d -A 127.0.0.1 -f /var/etc/frr/frr.conf`. After the zebra+ospfd restart, the OSPF routes install correctly and Eng/SOC hosts can reach the vcab DCs.

## 2026-07-01 · bug · roles/common/tasks/windows.yml — DDNS disable targets typo'd adapter names

**Symptom.** `Disable control net DNS registration` task in the base `common` role never actually disabled DDNS on the management interface — the mgmt IP (10.255.240.0/20) leaked into AD DNS on every Windows host. `Resolve-DnsName bs-dc01 -DnsOnly` round-robin resolved to the mgmt IP half the time; `Test-NetConnection bs-dc01` would occasionally hit the OOB mgmt interface. Symptom shows up as workstation→server flows that shouldn't work (mgmt is out-of-band) succeeding intermittently.

**Detection.**
```yaml
# roles/common/tasks/windows.yml (pre-fix)
- name: Disable control net DNS registration
  ansible.windows.win_powershell:
    script: |
      Get-NetAdapter {{ item }} | set-DnsClient -RegisterThisConnectionsAddress $false
  loop:
    - Ehternet0   # ← typo, never matches real "Ethernet0"
    - Ethernet2   # ← doesn't exist on airfield hosts (we use Ethernet0=mgmt, Ethernet1=prod)
```
`Get-NetAdapter` silently returns an empty pipeline on the misspelled/missing name; the task reports `ok=1` and never modifies anything.

**Root cause.** Upstream customer repo (`range-development-ansible/roles/common/tasks/windows.yml`) has the same typo — it was carried forward when we copied `common` into `airfield-range/roles/` per the role-sourcing policy. PowerPlant/ss-pp-ab flagged this in their `PROJECT_LOG.md` but couldn't fix the base role directly (they don't own the customer repo), so they layered a compensating play in `arbitr_pp_playbook.yaml`. Airfield-range owns its `roles/common/` copy, so we can fix the source.

**Fix (overlay).** Correct `Ehternet0 → Ethernet0` and drop the non-existent `Ethernet2` entry so the loop only touches the real mgmt adapter. Added an inline comment referencing this entry and the belt-and-suspenders `Strip mgmt interface from AD DNS registration` overlay play in `site.yml:479` which handles two additional scenarios (purging already-registered mgmt A records on the PDC + forcing a re-register so the data-plane record stays).

**Fix (upstream).** File an issue against the customer repo — the base `common` role should target the mgmt adapter by ROLE, not by hard-coded interface name, so it's portable across ranges.

## 2026-07-01 · bug · roles/pfsense_firewall/tasks/main.yml — dhclient-kill shell task rc=-15

**Symptom.** After the fresh-range dhclient poisoning fix landed (2026-06-30 entry above), the first end-to-end deploy on the next range failed on the pfSense play with:
```
fatal: [bs-ops-fw]: FAILED! => {"cmd": "set +e\npkill -f 'dhclient.*vmx[1-9]'...", "rc": -15, "delta": "0:00:01.006324", "stdout": "", "stderr": ""}
```
`rc=-15` = SIGTERM to the Python subprocess wrapping the SSH command. Delta of exactly 1.006 seconds pins the kill to just after `sleep 1`, before the follow-up pgrep/echo could run. Empty stdout+stderr means the shell died mid-script.

**Root cause (best understanding).** The original task was `ansible.builtin.shell` running a multi-line script (`set +e; pkill; sleep 1; pgrep; if...`). On pfSense 2.8.1 (FreeBSD 14 base), the pkill occasionally severs the running task's own SSH session lineage even though the `dhclient.*vmx[1-9]` regex doesn't match Ansible's connection process. Cause suspected: pfSense's `/usr/local/sbin/watchfrr` or `sysrc` respawn logic tracks process trees and can SIGTERM adjacent shell descendants when it kills+restarts dhclient. The 1-second sleep window is enough for that cascade to reach our task's shell.

**Fix (overlay).** Switch from `shell: |` (multi-line script with sleep) to `command:` (single atomic pkill invocation). No sleep, no follow-up pgrep, no nested shell. `pkill -f 'dhclient.*vmx[1-9]'` returns 0 if it killed something, 1 if no matches, >1 on error. `failed_when: false` + `changed_when: rc == 0` absorbs both non-error rc values cleanly. The watchdog daemon (already running from the previous deploy) handles any respawn within 30s.
