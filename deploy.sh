PLAYBOOK="site.yml"
# Ansible names the retry file after the playbook with the EXTENSION STRIPPED
# (site.yml -> site.retry), so this has to strip it too. Built as
# "$PLAYBOOK.retry" it yields site.yml.retry, which never exists -- and the
# `[ -f "$RETRY_FILE" ]` guard below then reads that as "no retry file was
# produced" and silently falls through to a full sweep. Attempt 2 had never
# once been retry-scoped. Caught on airfield 2026-09-15.

#   largest play target : 74  (windows,linux — the `common` play)

#
# Sized so the widest play runs in ONE batch. At 40 forks that 74-host play
# ran two rounds, the second only 34 wide, and those are the long plays. The
# margin is free: Ansible never spawns more workers than the play has hosts,
# so excess forks cost nothing, while being one short costs a whole extra
# round.
#
# TRADEOFF: each fork is a separate Python process, so this is a memory
# question rather than a CPU one -- workers are almost always blocked on
# WinRM/SSH I/O, not computing. UNVERIFIED ON THIS CONTROLLER: 76 forks is
# roughly 4-6 GB resident. If it swaps during a full sweep, drop this rather
# than assuming the deploy is slow for another reason.
#
# RECOUNT, do not increment, when hosts are added or removed. Adding a host
# to [windows] or [linux] moves the target this is derived from.

#                                 subsequent plays that also gather. Ansible
#                                 remembers what it already gathered.
#   ANSIBLE_CACHE_PLUGIN=jsonfile + fact_cache dir + 24h TTL — persist facts
#                                 across runs, so back-to-back deploys don't

# --- Install Galaxy collections (idempotent — skips already-installed ones) ---
# Required for the pfsensible.core collection that drives the pfSense plays
# (bs-edge-fw, bs-ops-fw). Pulled through the corp proxy because the Ansible
# VM doesn't have direct internet. Failure here doesn't abort the deploy —
# ansible-playbook will surface a clear "collection not found" error if
# anything's actually missing.
#
# NOTE: a `sleep 120` here was removed 2026-07-02 in a speed pass, reasoning
# that the retry loop already handles a VM that is not ready yet. RESTORED
# 2026-09-15 as BOOT_DELAY (see below), because that reasoning did not survive
# contact with a fresh range -- the same conclusion ss-pp-so reached on
# 2026-08-05. The retry loop does "handle" it, but only by paying for a full
# multi-hour sweep to discover the host was still booting. The legitimate half

# --- Let a freshly provisioned range finish booting --------------------------

#                       not exist yet -- no IP, no NIC, nothing to connect to.
#                       wait_for_connection cannot help there; it can only wait
#                       on a host that is at least present.
#   init_wait_timeout   per-host ceiling inside init. Costs NOTHING when a host
#                       is ready -- wait_for_connection returns the moment the
#                       connection succeeds -- so it is the cheap lever, and it
#                       only bites on hosts that are genuinely slow or dead.
#
# 300s, not ss-pp-so's 180s: this is the largest range of the four (86 hosts vs
# 74), and the provisioning tail scales with it. Observed twice on fresh
# deploys (2026-09-14 and 2026-09-15) that not every host had provisioned by
